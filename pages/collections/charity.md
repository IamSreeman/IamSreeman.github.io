This page contains donations I made to charities.

The purpose of this page is to show that I am trying to abide by my moral obligations. Ever since I first read the "drowning child" thought experiment by Peter Singer during the COVID lockdown, I understood that donating money beyond our basic necessities is a **moral obligation** and not an optional good we can do.

[Masters years](#masters)<br>
[Undergrad years](#undergrad)<br>

##### Masters

My masters was much more expensive than my undergrad and I couldn't donate due to financial problems.

##### Undergrad
