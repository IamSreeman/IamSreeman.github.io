Ever since I first read the "[drowning child](https://www.philosophyexperiments.com/singer/){:target="_blank"}" thought experiment by Peter Singer during the COVID lockdown, I understood that donating money after our basic necessities are met is a **moral obligation** and not a mere optional good we can do & this obligation is irrelevant to any emotional proximity such as if it happens in front of you or other side of the world.

I generally dislike Peter Singer, as he is the main theoretical leader of Animal Welfarists, with the practical arm being the organization PETA. I only support Abolitionist Animal Rights Activists. Welfarists give humane killing equipment, which is as misguided as giving humane whips to 19th-century Confederate enslavers.

##### PhD years

Even in my PhD I am not donating as much as I would have wanted to because of my masters education loan which is huge.

##### Masters

My masters was much more expensive than my undergrad and I couldn't donate due to financial problems.
