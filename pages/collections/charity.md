This page contains donations I made to charities.

The purpose of this page is to show that I am trying to abide by my moral obligations. Ever since I first read the "[drowning child](https://www.philosophyexperiments.com/singer/){:target="_blank"}" thought experiment by Peter Singer during the COVID lockdown, I understood that donating money beyond our basic necessities is a **moral obligation** and not an optional good we can do.

##### PhD years


##### Masters

My masters was much more expensive than my undergrad and I couldn't donate due to financial problems.
