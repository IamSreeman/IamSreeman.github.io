Ever since I first read the "[drowning child](https://www.philosophyexperiments.com/singer/){:target="_blank"}" thought experiment by Peter Singer during the COVID lockdown, I understood that donating money after our basic necessities are met is a **moral obligation** and not a mere optional good we can do & this obligation is irrelevant to any emotional proximity such as if it happens in front of you or other side of the world.

I generally dislike Peter Singer, as he is the main theoretical leader of Animal Welfarists, with the practical arm being the organization PETA. I only support Abolitionist Animal Rights Activists. Welfarists give humane killing equipment, which is as misguided as giving humane whips to 19th-century Confederate enslavers.

##### PhD years

Even in my PhD I am not donating as much as I would have wanted to because of my ~60k$ masters education loan which is huge.

| Date       | Amount | Organization | Image | Details |
|------------|--------|------|-------|------------------|
| 2025-10-08 | ₹1331.14=$15.00 | Allied Scholars | [2025-10-08-AS]({{site.baseurl}}/images/other/charity/2025-10-08-AS.pdf){:target="_blank"} | Almost all movements like women's rights, black rights, LGBT rights were 1st accepted by university students before the public. So, the 1st goal should be to persuade universities that animals have rights. |
| 2025-10-08 | ₹887.43=$10.00 | Gaza Water | [2025-10-08-GW]({{site.baseurl}}/images/other/charity/2025-10-08-GW.pdf){:target="_blank"} | Maia Project: Bringing Clean Water to the Children of Palestine. Clean water became harder to obtain due to the disproportionate war. |
| 2025-10-08 | ₹887.43=$10.00 | Arvind Animal Activist | [2025-10-08-AAA]({{site.baseurl}}/images/other/charity/2025-10-08-AAA.pdf){:target="_blank"} | Arvind's videos are how I heard the word "vegan" for the 1st time. He is the biggest contributor to veganism in the country with the most humans. The Animal Holocaust is murdering 80 billion land animals, 2 trillion fishes & 25 trillion crustaceans yearly. |
| 2025-10-08 | ₹1191.29=£10.00 | Khartoum Aid Kitchen | [2025-10-08-KAK]({{site.baseurl}}/images/other/charity/2025-10-08-KAK.pdf){:target="_blank"} | By [2025-01-18](https://web.archive.org/web/20250118191727/https://sudantribune.net/article296185/){:target="_blank"}, 522,000 children died from starvation alone caused by the Sudanese Civil War. But it got very little attention compared to Gaza/Ukraine/Syria, maybe due to [colourism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination_based_on_skin_tone){:target="_blank"}. |

##### Masters

My masters was many times more expensive than all my education till that point and I couldn't donate due to financial problems.

##### Undergrad

| Date       | Amount | Organization | Image | Details |
