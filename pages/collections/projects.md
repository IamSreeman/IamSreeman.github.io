##### String dual of 2D QCD (Jan 2025-Present)

*Advisor: Prof. Ofer Aharony, Weizmann Institute of Science*
- Understanding the precise worldsheet theory that is dual to 2D QCD with massive quarks

##### Quantum covariant bit threads (Oct 2023-Present)

*Advisor: Prof. Matthew Headrick, Brandeis University*
- Studied several papers about the bit thread formulation of holographic entanglement entropy, especially
”Quantum bit threads” (2105.08072) and ”Covariant bit threads” (2208.10507)
- Proposed 8 versions of ”Quantum covariant bit threads” that unify the quantum static version 2105.08072 with the classical covariant versions 2208.10507 and showed that they have the expected properties.
- Proved that all these definitions are equivalent to the Quantum Extremal Surface (QES) prescription.

##### Sparse Double-Scaled SYK (Oct 2023-Feb 2024)

*Advisor: Prof. Brian Swingle, Brandeis University*
- Studied the chord diagram technique that can be used to solve Double Scaled SYK at all energy scales and $\lambda$.
- Studied the sparse version of SYK.
- Worked on sparsifying the Double Scaled SYK and developing hyperchord diagram technique for calculating next-order corrections to sparse DSSYK, and also working on sparsifying ${\mathcal N} = 1$ and ${\mathcal N} = 2$ supersymmetric DSSYK.

##### Holographic description of M-theory (Nov-Dec 2023)

*Advisor: Prof. Daniel Jafferis, Harvard University*
- Studied the duality between $AdS\_{4}\times S^{7}/\mathbb{Z}_{k}$ M-theory and the $\mathcal N = 6$ $U(N)\_k \times U(N)\_{-k}$ super Chern–Simons theory (ABJM CFT).
- Gave a presentation focusing on the M2-brane construction and obtaining the gravity dual.

##### Quantum Raychaudhuri Equation and its applications to cosmology (May-July 2022)

*Advisor: Prof. Saurya Das, University of Lethbridge, Canada*
- Studied a semi-classical gravity theory obtained by replacing classical geodesics in the Raychaudhuri
equation with Bohmian trajectories.
- Studied a cosmological model within this theory where both dark matter and dark energy are unified
into a dark Bose-Einstein condensate.
- Implemented a special case of this theory in CLASS and estimated the cosmological parameters by
doing Monte Carlo sampling in Cobaya using Planck 2018 data.

##### Black hole information paradox (June-November 2021)

*Advisor: Prof. Vikram Rentala, IIT Bombay*
- Studied quantum scalar field theory in curved spacetime and how it compares with QFT in ﬂat spacetime.
- Reviewed the four laws of black hole mechanics and their similarity with thermodynamics and Penrose process in a Kerr black hole.
- Studied **Unruh effect** which explains that the vacuum state of a Minkowski observer will be a thermal state as observed by a Rindler observer and how entanglement between the left and right Rindler wedges prevents a firewall at the Rindler horizon.
- Studied **Hawking radiation** and the conditions under which a black hole can be in stable or unstable equilibrium.
- Assuming that the evaporation is unitary, studied the characteristics of **Page curve** using the **Page theorem**.<br>

##### Category theory applications in physics (October-November 2020)
*Advisor: Prof. Vikram Rentala, IIT Bombay*
- Studied basic concepts of category theory like Functors, Natural transformations, Monoidal categories.
- Studied axiomatization of physical systems using strict monoidal categories.
- Investigated **FdHilb** category and studied **no-cloning, no-deleting theorems** in categorical quantum mechanics.<br>
