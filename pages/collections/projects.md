##### Category theory applications in physics (October-November 2020)
This project deals with using category theory in Quantum Mechanics. In the end we will see a proof of No-cloning theorem using category theory.

##### Covid-19:analysis of a modified SEIR model (October-November 2020)

**Abstract**: Modelling of infectious diseases is not only an interesting example of nonlinear
dynamics, it is also very useful to decide what types of interventions should governments do to contain the disease as early as possible. Among social distancing
(SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ) we explain that for same target R0target < 1,
TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than lock-downs that only implement SD. This project report is based on the paper [arXiv:2005.11511 [q-bio.PE]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11511).

##### Special and General Relativity (April 2020)

**Abstract**: First we are going to review concepts of special theory of relativity from basic postulates. We then introduce Tensors and Tensor calculus and after that we deal with basic General Relativity. We are using the Einstein notation(1916) and not the new Abstract index notation of Penrose and Rindler(1984).

It is a Summer of Science(SoS) report. If you want the tex files you can [download here](https://github.com/IamSreeman/LaTeX/tree/master/Special%20and%20General%20Relativity).
