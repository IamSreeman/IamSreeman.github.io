##### Quantum Raychaudhuri Equation and its applications to cosmology (May-July 2022)
*Supervisor: Prof. Saurya Das, Dept. of Physics and Astronomy, University of Lethbridge, Canada*
- Studied a semi-classical gravity theory obtained by replacing classical geodesics in the Raychaudhuri
equation with Bohmian trajectories.
- Studied a cosmological model within this theory where both dark matter and dark energy are unified
into a dark Bose-Einstein condensate.
- Implemented a special case of this theory in CLASS and estimated the cosmological parameters by
doing Monte Carlo sampling in Cobaya using Planck 2018 data.
##### Black hole information paradox (June-November 2021)
*Supervisor: Prof. Vikram Rentala*
- Studied quantum scalar field theory in curved spacetime and how it compares with QFT in ﬂat spacetime.
- Reviewed the four laws of black hole mechanics and their similarity with thermodynamics and Penrose process in a Kerr black hole.
- Studied **Unruh effect** which explains that the vacuum state of a Minkowski observer will be a thermal state as observed by a Rindler observer and how entanglement between the left and right Rindler wedges prevents a firewall at the Rindler horizon.
- Studied **Hawking radiation** and the conditions under which a black hole can be in stable or unstable equilibrium.
- Assuming that the evaporation is unitary, studied the characteristics of **Page curve** using the **Page theorem**.<br>

##### Higgs mechanism (April 2022)

*Supervisor: Prof. Urjit Yajnik, Dept. of Physics, IIT Bombay*
- Studied how abelian and non-abelian gauge bosons can become massive using spontaneous symmetry
breaking.
- Studied how the theory is renormalizable even after gauge bosons acquire mass through Higgs mecha-
nism using $R_\xi$ gauges.
##### Category theory applications in physics (October-November 2020)
*Supervisor: Prof. Vikram Rentala*
- Studied basic concepts of category theory like Functors, Natural transformations, Monoidal categories.
- Studied axiomatization of physical systems using strict monoidal categories.
\item Investigated **FdHilb** category and studied **no-cloning, no-deleting theorems** in categorical quantum mechanics.<br>

##### One-dimensional photonic bound states in the continuum (March-April 2021)

*Supervisor: Prof. Anshuman Kumar, Dept. of Physics, IIT Bombay*
- Studied bound states in the continuum (BICs) which emerge due to precise destructive interference of waves for an electron in a one-dimensional quantum well under an external magnetic field.
- Using the correspondence between the spin states of the above electron model and the polarisation states of an one dimensional photonic system made up of an anisotropic layer conjugated with a 1D photonic crystals consisting of alternating layers, found BICs for the photonic system.
- Calculated numerical values and generated graphs of several quantities such as transmittance, reflectance, Q factor, wave function using python for both the electron model and the photonic model.<br>

##### Covid-19:analysis of a modified SEIR model (October-November 2020)
*Supervisor: Prof. Amitabha Nandi, Dept. of Physics, IIT Bombay*
- Studied the normal Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model. Later used a modified model to incorporates the fact that asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals play a significant role in the transmission of Covid-19.
- Generated different projections for India under different intervention parameters.
- By varying intervention parameters in the modified model we concluded that testing-quarantining is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than lockdowns.<br>

##### Special and General Relativity (April 2020)
*Guide: Summer of Science mentor under Maths and Physics Club, IIT Bombay*
- Studied the principles of relativity. Started with Special Relativity and then read the mathematical prerequisites for General Relativity.
- Studied General Relativity till Schwarzschild metric and analyzed the properties of Schwarzschild black holes in Schwarzschild coordinates
and Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates.<br>
