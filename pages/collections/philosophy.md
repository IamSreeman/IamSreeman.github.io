3. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/raison_d%27%C3%AAtre" target="_blank">Raison d'être</a> of sapient species[^MeaningOfLife]: This is the meaning of life. Arranged in ascending order of hardness. Only the 1st and 2nd ones seem possible for our species in this century.
    1. Understanding the fundamental laws of physics
    1. Eradicating all immorality and involuntary suffering caused by our species (wars, animal agriculture, childhood religious indoctrination [[post](https://ksr.onl/blog/2021/09/right-to-be-not-brainwashed.html){:target="_blank"}] etc)
    1. Eradicating all immorality and involuntary suffering in nature ***not*** caused by our species. This includes:
        - Death: Achieving immortality either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_immortality" target="_blank">biologically</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_immortality" target="_blank">digitally</a> and then the world government should make everyone (who wants) immortal.
        - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_animal_suffering" target="_blank">Wild animal suffering</a>: We should solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation_problem" target="_blank">predation problem</a> and <a href="https://herbivorizepredators.org/" target="_blank">Herbivorize Predators</a> without violating the rights of predators. Then we should give all animals enough cognitive abilities so that they will become sapient and have meaning in their life. Then we should give immortality to all those sapient beings who wants. See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10008771/" target="_blank">PMC10008771</a>, to understand that currently this is much less suffering than animal agriculture. See <a href="https://wildanimalsuffering.org/" target="_blank">wildanimalsuffering.org</a>.
    1. Becoming an advanced civilization: As advanced as our laws of physics allow
        - Society should achieve something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson%27s_eternal_intelligence" target="_blank">Dyson's eternal intelligence</a> (it doesn't work for positive cosmological constant) so that they can espace the heat death of the universe.
        - We should upgrade our body's energy efficiency. Instead of eating 3 times a day, which is mundane, we should use an efficient process like every million years once, we should take a few grams of matter and a few grams of antimatter, and they slowly annihilate in our stomach.
        - We should use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification" target="_blank">Intelligence Amplification</a> to become much more intelligent than biological humans.
        - Become powerful like the following species: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/f5rj7k/respect_the_xeelee_xeelee_sequence/" target="_blank">Xeelee</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/f6as78/respect_the_photino_birds_xeelee_sequence/" target="_blank">Photino birds</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture" target="_blank">The Culture</a>, <a href="https://hyperioncantos.fandom.com/wiki/Hegemony_of_Man" target="_blank">Hegemony of Man</a> etc.
4. Past beliefs: 1) Hinduism (till ~2012), 2) Buddhism (~2012-2013), 3) Negative utilitarianism (till 2021), 4) Rationalism/Empiricism[^Antifoundationalism] (till 2021), 4) Welfarist veganism[^Abolitionist] (till mid 2022)
5. Afraid of: 1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism" target="_blank">Philosophical skepticism</a> [check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma" target="_blank">Münchhausen trilemma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem" target="_blank">Gettier problem</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acatalepsy" target="_blank">Acatalepsy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism" target="_blank">Solipsism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aj%C3%B1ana" target="_blank">Ajñana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhonism#Philosophy" target="_blank">Pyrrhonism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoramus_et_ignorabimus" target="_blank">Ignorabimus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_doubt" target="_blank">Cartesian doubt</a> and also slightly related things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction" target="_blank">Problem of induction</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem" target="_blank">Is–ought problem</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems" target="_blank">Gödel's incompleteness theorems</a>], 2) The amorality of the laws of physics, 3) Death, 4) Having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance" target="_blank">cognitive dissonance</a> and moral blind spots on issues I haven't thought about and 5) Not living long enough to see any experimental data related to quantum gravity.
6. Miscellaneous:
    - I think the answer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_is_there_anything_at_all%3F" target="_blank">Why is there anything at all?</a> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument" target="_blank">ontological argument</a> that argues for the existence of the laws of physics. In principle, this might look like rationalism, but as a footnote below explains, I am an antifoundationalist. We can't ***uniquely*** deduce the greatest entity (laws of physics) by reason alone. My pantheism is not a religion because I define religion as "any dogmatic belief surrounding afterlife". [[post](https://ksr.onl/blog/2024/07/an-ontological-argument-for-fundamental-physics.html){:target="_blank"}]
    - I think True Love (= Unconditional compassion towards all sentient beings) is only possible for an omnipotent being, and even then, it is True Love only in one direction, and it is discrimination in the other direction. [[post](https://ksr.onl/blog/2024/07/love-is-discrimination.html){:target="_blank"}]
    - I really like the elegance of the laws of physics. But I would much rather prefer inelegant ***moral*** laws of physics than the elegant ***amoral*** laws of physics that exist in reality.
    - Like [FM-2030](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-2030){:target="_blank"}, I think the widespread practice of naming conventions exists only as a relic of humanity's tribalistic past. If I had high confidence that biologists would drastically increase human lifespan within my lifetime, I would have renamed myself as KSR-12002.
    - I think Alvin Plantinga's [reformed epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_epistemology){:target="_blank"} argument that no basis (arguments, evidence etc) for belief in God is necessary is the ***most ridiculous argument*** in the history of human thought. The main duty of a philosopher is to oppose Dogma, but Plantinga justifies Dogma. The 2nd most ridiculous argument is the [argument from reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_reason){:target="_blank"} by C. S. Lewis.

[^Sentient]:
    Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_circle_expansion" target="_blank">moral circle expanded</a> from originally consisting of only the males of the same tribe to later include males of the same ethnicity, race, nationality etc and also eventually all humans of all countries, including non males. The last step in our moral evolution will be to include all sentient beings in our moral circle and this is called ***Sentiocentrism*** or ***Sentientism***. Plants are not sentient. Most animals are sentient and can suffer. There are a few animals, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge" target="_blank">sponges</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral" target="_blank">corals</a>, etc, that are not sentient. There are also a few animals, like insects, that we do not yet know if they are sentient. In general, if an animal has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system" target="_blank">central nervous system</a> then it likely is sentient and can feel pain. Casteism, linguicism, ethnocentrism, nationalism, religionism, racism, sexism, humanism (=anthropocentric speciesism) etc are all tribalistic compared to Sentiocentrism. People very often think their caste or ethnicity or race or species is superior to others and therefore they can oppress others. That is, of course, immoral nonsense.<br>
    Sapiocentrism/Sapientism gives moral weight to all sapient (i.e. capable of abstract thinking) beings. Since we Homo sapiens have never met another sapient (alien) species, in practice, Sapiocentrism = Anthropocentrism, and both are part of Speciesism. Speciesism can be manifest in many different forms, for example, giving some rights to dogs but not giving the same rights to pigs, cows, etc. Check <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/9780191966729.001.0001" target="_blank">The Edge of Sentience</a> book.<br>
    The gravity of the situation can not be overstated because each year, trillions ([1](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wild-caught-fish){:target="_blank"},[2](https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/shrimp-the-animals-most-commonly-used-and-killed-for-food-production){:target="_blank"},[3](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/farmed-crustaceans){:target="_blank"},[4](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/farmed-fish-killed){:target="_blank"}) of sentient animals are needlessly tortured and killed.

[^MeaningOfLife]:
    By this, I mean this is the meaning of life for any sapient species. For non sapient species I think there is no meaning of life. On this planet, we Homo sapiens are the only sapient species. Nonsapient species are not moral agents, so you can not morally judge them.

[^Antifoundationalism]: After going back and forth between <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/" target="_blank">Rationalism vs. Empiricism</a>, I became an antifoundationalist. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurath%27s_boat" target="_blank">Neurath's boat</a> simile, I think the situation is even worse because of philosophical skepticism which is like a shark making it harder to gain knowledge. Even if you know swimming, you can't build the boat from scratch because the shark will eat you. So, you can't have a single foundation and must use a mixture of reason, empirical data etc.

[^Abolitionist]: I stopped being a welfarist and became an abolitionist after reading Gary L. Francione's <a href="https://www.abolitionistapproach.com/about/the-six-principles-of-the-abolitionist-approach-to-animal-rights/" target="_blank">six principles</a>.

[^Antinatalism]:
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benatar%27s_asymmetry_argument" target="_blank">Benatar's asymmetry argument</a> is the best argument for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism" target="_blank">antinatalism</a>. I can never accept antinatalism because I can't accept that my birth is immoral for reasons similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Respect_Movement" target="_blank">Self-Respect Movement</a>. I have always found that antinatalism is a very logical argument and failed to find a mistake. But in 2022, when I read Nozick's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine" target="_blank">experience machine</a> I was happy because I think it solves the issue of antinatalism. He used it to argue against utilitarianism. But the argument tries to explain that there is something inherently positive about existing in reality. And that can also be used to argue against antinatalism. Nagel also thinks that experiencing reality is inherently positive.

    >“All of us, I believe, are fortunate to have been born.”

    >“There are elements which, if added to one's experience, make life better; there are other elements which if added to one's experience, make life worse. But what remains when these are set aside is not merely neutral: it is emphatically positive. ... The additional positive weight is supplied by experience itself, rather than by any of its consequences.”
