3. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/raison_d%27%C3%AAtre" target="_blank">Raison d'être</a> of sapient species[^MeaningOfLife]: Arranged in ascending order of hardness. Only the 1st one seems possible for our species in this century.
    1. Understanding the fundamental laws of physics
    1. Eradicating all immorality and involuntary suffering caused by our species (wars, animal agriculture, childhood religious indoctrination [[post](https://ksr.onl/n/blog/2021/09/right-to-be-not-brainwashed.html){:target="_blank"}] etc)
    1. Eradicating all immorality and involuntary suffering in nature ***not*** caused by our species. This includes:
        - Death: Achieving immortality either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_immortality" target="_blank">biologically</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_immortality" target="_blank">digitally</a> and then the world government should make everyone (who wants) immortal.
        - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_animal_suffering" target="_blank">Wild animal suffering</a>: We should solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation_problem" target="_blank">predation problem</a> and <a href="https://herbivorizepredators.org/" target="_blank">Herbivorize Predators</a> without violating the rights of predators. Then we should give all animals enough cognitive abilities so that they will become sapient and have meaning in their life. Then we should give immortality to all those sapient beings who wants. See <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10008771/" target="_blank">PMC10008771</a>, to understand that currently this is much less suffering than animal agriculture. See <a href="https://wildanimalsuffering.org/" target="_blank">wildanimalsuffering.org</a>.
    1. Becoming an advanced civilization: As advanced as our laws of physics allow
        - Society should achieve something like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson%27s_eternal_intelligence" target="_blank">Dyson's eternal intelligence</a> (it doesn't work for positive cosmological constant) so that they can espace the heat death of the universe.
        - Become powerful like the following species: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/f5rj7k/respect_the_xeelee_xeelee_sequence/" target="_blank">Xeelee</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/f6as78/respect_the_photino_birds_xeelee_sequence/" target="_blank">Photino birds</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Culture" target="_blank">The Culture</a>, <a href="https://hyperioncantos.fandom.com/wiki/Hegemony_of_Man" target="_blank">Hegemony of Man</a> etc.
4. Past beliefs: 1) Hinduism (till ~2012), 2) Buddhism (~2012-2013), 3) Negative utilitarianism (till 2021), 4) Rationalism/Empiricism[^Antifoundationalism] (till 2021), 4) Welfarist veganism[^Abolitionist] (till mid 2022)
5. Afraid of: 1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism" target="_blank">Philosophical skepticism</a> [check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma" target="_blank">Münchhausen trilemma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem" target="_blank">Gettier problem</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acatalepsy" target="_blank">Acatalepsy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism" target="_blank">Solipsism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aj%C3%B1ana" target="_blank">Ajñana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrhonism#Philosophy" target="_blank">Pyrrhonism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoramus_et_ignorabimus" target="_blank">Ignorabimus</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_doubt" target="_blank">Cartesian doubt</a> and also slightly related things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction" target="_blank">Problem of induction</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem" target="_blank">Is–ought problem</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems" target="_blank">Gödel's incompleteness theorems</a>], 2) The amorality of the laws of physics, 3) Death, 4) Having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance" target="_blank">cognitive dissonance</a> and moral blind spots on issues I haven't thought about and 5) Not living long enough to see any experimental data related to quantum gravity.
6. Miscellaneous:
    - I think the answer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_is_there_anything_at_all%3F" target="_blank">Why is there anything at all?</a> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument" target="_blank">ontological argument</a> that argues for the existence of the laws of physics. In principle, this might look like rationalism, but as a footnote below explains, I am an antifoundationalist. We can't ***uniquely*** deduce the greatest entity (laws of physics) by reason alone. [[post](https://ksr.onl/blog/2024/07/an-ontological-argument-for-fundamental-physics.html){:target="_blank"}]
    - I really like the elegance of the laws of physics. But I would much rather prefer inelegant ***moral*** laws of physics than the elegant ***amoral*** laws of physics that exist in reality.
    - Like [FM-2030](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM-2030){:target="_blank"}, I think the widespread practice of naming conventions exists only as a relic of humankind's tribalistic past. If I had high confidence that biologists would drastically increase human lifespan within my lifetime, I would have renamed myself as KSR-12002.
    - I think Alvin Plantinga's [reformed epistemology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_epistemology){:target="_blank"} argument that no basis (arguments, evidence etc) for belief in God is necessary is the ***most ridiculous argument*** in the history of human thought. The 2nd most ridiculous argument is the [argument from reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_reason){:target="_blank"} by C. S. Lewis.

[^Sentient]:
    Our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_circle_expansion" target="_blank">moral circle expanded</a> from originally consisting of only the males of the same tribe to later include males of the same ethnicity, race, nationality etc and also eventually all humans of all countries, including non males. The last step in our moral evolution will be to include all sentient beings in our moral circle and this is called Sentiocentrism. Plants are not sentient. Most animals except <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge" target="_blank">sponges</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral" target="_blank">corals</a> etc are sentient and can suffer. Casteism, linguicism, ethnocentrism, nationalism, religionism, racism, sexism, speciesism etc are all tribalistic compared to Sentiocentrism. People very often think their caste or ethnicity or race or species is superior to others and therefore they can oppress others. That is, of course, immoral.<br>
    Sapiocentrism/Sapientism gives moral weight to all sapient (i.e. capable of abstract thinking) beings. Since we Homo sapiens have never met another sapient (alien) species, in practice, Sapiocentrism = Anthropocentrism, and both are part of Speciesism. Speciesism can be manifest in many different forms, for example, giving some rights to dogs but not giving the same rights to pigs, cows, etc. Check <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/9780191966729.001.0001" target="_blank">The Edge of Sentience</a> book.

[^MeaningOfLife]:
    By this, I mean this is the meaning of life for any sapient species. For non sapient species I think there is no meaning of life. On this planet, we Homo sapiens are the only sapient species. Nonsapient species are not moral agents, so you can not morally judge them.

[^Antifoundationalism]: After going back and forth between <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/" target="_blank">Rationalism vs. Empiricism</a>, I became an antifoundationalist. In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurath%27s_boat" target="_blank">Neurath's boat</a> simile, I think the situation is even worse because of philosophical skepticism which is like a shark making it harder to gain knowledge. Even if you know swimming, you can't build the boat from scratch because the shark will eat you. So, you can't have a single foundation and must use a mixture of reason, empirical data etc.

[^Abolitionist]: I stopped being a welfarist and became an abolitionist after reading Gary L. Francione's <a href="https://www.abolitionistapproach.com/about/the-six-principles-of-the-abolitionist-approach-to-animal-rights/" target="_blank">six principles</a>.
