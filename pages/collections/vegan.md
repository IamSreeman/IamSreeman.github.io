#### Reasons

The following are the reasons why I made this decision. 

##### Moral

- Meat and Dairy products are not necessary for humans to live and the practise of consuming these is easily the most evil thing that is happening right now on planet earth.
- Currently each year 80 billion land animals are slaughtered for food. Sources: [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_slaughter), [2](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL)<br>

- The number of individual wild fish killed each year is estimated as 0.97-2.74 trillion (based on FAO tonnage statistics combined with estimated mean weights of fish species).[2] The FAO numbers do not include illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, nor discarded fish. If these are included and over-reporting by China subtracted, the totals increase by about 16.6% to 33.3%.[2] A similar estimate for the number of farmed fish slaughtered each year is 0.037 to 0.120 trillion.

This is easily the most important argument for veganism. Maybe after some centuries we will be advanced enough to kill animals and eat their dead bodies with causing pollution, cancer, heart diseases etc. Even then it is not morally OK to not be a vegan because of the ethical issues.

When I was a child I was a vegetarian and I used to think that there is nothing morally wrong with drinking milk since we are not killing the cows or buffaloes. In the middle of my 9th class my biology teacher said that eating meat is necessary to be healthy and he gave several reasons why it is beneficial to health. Because of that I became a meat eater and ate chicken in 2 meals for the next 4 years. Now I know that it is actually healthier to be a vegan. But looking back even if it was true that carnism is slightly more healthier than veganism (which is certainly false) it is not morally OK to eat meat.

But in early 2020, I found out what actually happens in the dairy industry by watching [this](https://fb.watch/cTX_VxvCv9/) and some other videos posted by [Arvind Animal Activist](https://www.facebook.com/ArvindAnimalActivist). But I was not sure if it was healthy to go vegan. But after watching many videos of [Erin Janus](https://www.youtube.com/c/ErinJanus) and [Earthling Ed](https://www.youtube.com/c/EarthlingEdChannel) I decided to go vegan. But then covid lockdown happened. After covid started I became a lacto-vegetarian but not a vegan because of some stupid reasons which are definitely not good enough excuses to support the dairy industry for 2 years.



##### Environmental
- Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than all transportation emissions combined. [Source](https://www.fao.org/3/a0701e/a0701e00.htm)

##### Health
- This comprehensive meta-analysis reports a significant protective effect of a vegetarian diet versus the incidence and/or mortality from ischemic heart disease (-25%) and incidence from total cancer (-8%). Vegan diet conferred a significant reduced risk (-15%) of incidence from total cancer. [Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26853923/)
- The World Health Organization has classified processed meats including ham, bacon, salami and frankfurts as a Group 1 carcinogen (known to cause cancer) which means that there's strong evidence that processed meats cause cancer. Eating processed meat increases your risk of bowel and stomach cancer. [Source](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/1in3cancers/lifestyle-choices-and-cancer/red-meat-processed-meat-and-cancer/)

##### World hunger
- One in nine people in the world today are undernourished, yet we feed around a third of our global crop production to animals. If we cut out the middleman and ate the crops ourselves, instead of feeding them to animals, we could feed an additional four billion people – more than enough for everyone, for many years to come! We all know how wasteful old gas-guzzling cars are – how long before livestock farming is viewed in the same way: As a shameful, inefficient waste of resources. [Source](https://viva.org.uk/planet/the-issues/world-hunger/)

##### Holocene extinction
- Since 1970, the collective weight of free-living animals has declined 82%. Instead, a small number of farmed animals (mainly cows and pigs) dominate the global biomass. They account for 60% of mammal species by mass, 36% goes to humans, and just 4% are free-living animals. Sources: [1](https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/2021-02/2021-02-03-food-system-biodiversity-loss-benton-et-al_0.pdf), [2](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1711842115)
- Meat is considered one of the prime factors contributing to the current biodiversity loss crisis.

##### Antibiotic resistance
- Worldwide an estimated 73% of antimicrobials (mainly antibiotics) are consumed by farm animals. As resistance to antibiotics becomes more common there is greater need for alternative treatments. Calls for new antibiotic therapies have been issued, but new drug development is becoming rarer. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_resistance)
