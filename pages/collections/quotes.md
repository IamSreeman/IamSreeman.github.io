### Physicists

>“Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler" target="_blank">John Archibald Wheeler</a>

>“If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9" target="_blank">Henri Poincaré</a>

>“I worked horribly strenuously, strange that one can endure that.”<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>

>“Imagine my joy at the feasibility of general covariance and the result that the equations give the perihelion motion of Mercury correctly. For a few days I was beside myself with joyous excitement.”

>“At present I occupy myself exclusively with the problem of gravitation and now believe that I shall master all difficulties with the help of a friendly mathematician here (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Grossmann" target="_blank">Marcel Grossmann</a>). But one thing is certain, in all my life I have never labored nearly as hard, and I have become imbued with **great respect for mathematics, the subtler part of which I had in my simple-mindedness regarded as pure luxury until now**. Compared with this problem, the original relativity is child’s play.” [After nearly ten years of hard work, in a letter to  A. Sommerfeld]

>“People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a **stubbornly persistent illusion.**”

>“I believe with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank">Schopenhauer</a>: ***We can do what we wish, but we can only wish what we must***. Practically, I am, nevertheless, compelled to act as if freedom of the will existed. If I wish to live in a civilized community, I must act as if man is a responsible being. I know that philosophically a murderer is not responsible for his crime; nevertheless, I must protect myself from unpleasant contacts. I may consider him guiltless, but I prefer not to take tea with him.”

>“It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. **I do not believe in a personal God** and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.”

>“I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modelled after our own — a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbour such thoughts through **fear or ridiculous egotisms**.”

>“**I claim credit for nothing**. Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect as well as for the star. Human beings, vegetables or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible player.”

>“I believe in Spinoza's God, Who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.”

>“How can it be that **mathematics**, being, after all, a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is **so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?** Is human reason, then, without experience, merely by taking thought, able to fathom the properties of real things?”

>“One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.”

>“Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into **lazy habits of thinking**.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank">Albert Einstein</a>

>“Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ...”

>“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.”

>“To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. 'Tis much better to do a little with certainty, & leave the rest for others that come after you, than to explain all things by conjecture without making sure of any thing.”

>“I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.”

>“I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses; for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called a hypothesis, and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy.”

>“Plato is my friend — Aristotle is my friend — but my greatest friend is truth.”

>“I have studied these things — you have not.”<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">Isaac Newton</a>

>“Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. ***What one fool can do, another can.***”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvanus_P._Thompson" target="_blank">Silvanus P. Thompson</a>

>“The black holes of nature are **the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe**: the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time. And since the general theory of Relativity provides only a single unique family of solutions for their descriptions, they are the simplest objects as well.”<sup id="a3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar" target="_blank">Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</a>

>“I cannot understand why we idle discussing **religion**. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of **false assertions**, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why **primitive people**, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling.
>
>But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the **postulate** of an **Almighty God** helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit.
>
>Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of **all mortal sins**.”<sup id="a4"><a href="#f4">4</a></sup>

>“The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination.”

>“It seems clear that the present quantum mechanics is not in its final form. Some further changes will be needed, just about as drastic as the changes made in passing from Bohr's orbit theory to quantum mechanics. Some day a new quantum mechanics, a relativistic one, will be discovered, in which we will not have these infinities occurring at all. It might very well be that the new quantum mechanics will have determinism in the way that Einstein wanted.”

>“There was difficulty reconciling the Newtonian theory of gravitation with its instantaneous propagation of forces with the requirements of special relativity; and Einstein working on this difficulty was led to a generalization of his relativity—which was probably the greatest scientific discovery that was ever made.”

>“The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It therefore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac" target="_blank">P.A.M Dirac</a>

>“Most of us do elementary-particle physics neither because of the intrinsic interestingness of the phenomena that we study, nor because of the practical importance of what we learn, but because we are pursuing a reductionist vision. All of the properties of ordinary matter are what they are because of the principles of atomic and nuclear physics, which are what they are because of the rules of the Standard Model of elementary particles, which are what they are because…well, we don’t know, this is the reductionist frontier, which we are currently exploring.”

>“Religion is an insult to **human dignity**. Without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.But for good people to do evil things, that takes **religion**.”

>“I think the world needs to wake up from its long nightmare of religious belief; and anything that we scientists can do to ***weaken the hold of religion*** should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.

>“I have a friend — or had a friend, now dead — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam" target="_blank">Abdus Salam</a>, a very devout Muslim, who was trying to bring science into the universities in the Gulf states and he told me that he had a terrible time because, although they were very receptive to technology, they felt that science would be a corrosive to religious belief, and they were worried about it... and damn it, I think they were right. ***It is corrosive of religious belief, and it's a good thing too***.”

>“The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more **it also seems pointless**.”

>“Despite the weakness of the early experimental evidence for general relativity, Einstein’s theory became the standard textbook theory of gravitation in the 1920s and retained that position from then on, even while the various eclipse expeditions of the 1920s and 1930s were reporting at best equivocal evidence for the theory. … Perhaps all of us were just gullible and lucky, but I do not think that is the real explanation. I believe that the general acceptance of general relativity was due in large part to the attractions of the theory itself—in short, to its **beauty**.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg" target="_blank">Steven Weinberg</a>

>“Black holes ain't as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought. Things can get out of a black hole, both to the outside, and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up. There's a way out.”

>“We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can **understand the Universe**. That makes us something very special.”

>“The human race is just a chemical scum on a moderate-sized planet, orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies. We are so insignificant that I can't believe the whole universe exists for our benefit. That would be like saying that you would disappear if I closed my eyes.” 

>“There ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions of the universe and what can be more special than that there is no boundary?”

>“I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first ... I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.”

>“I used to think that information was destroyed in black holes. But the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence" target="_blank">AdS/CFT correspondence</a> led me to change my mind. This was my biggest blunder, or at least my biggest blunder in science.”

>“[on the possibility of contact with an alien civilization]: I think it would be a disaster. The extraterrestrials would probably be far in advance of us. The history of advanced races meeting more primitive people on this planet is not very happy, and they were the same species. I think we should keep our heads low.”

>“Einstein is the only figure in the physical sciences with a stature that can be compared with Newton. Newton is reported to have said "If I have seen further than other men, it is because I stood on the shoulders of giants." This remark is even more true of Einstein who stood on the shoulders of Newton. Both Newton and Einstein put forward a theory of mechanics and a theory of gravity but Einstein was able to base General Relativity on the mathematical theory of curved spaces that had been constructed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann" target="_blank">Riemann</a> while Newton had to develop his own mathematical machinery. It is therefore appropriate to acclaim Newton as the greatest figure in mathematical physics and the Principia is his greatest achievement.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" target="_blank">Stephen Hawking</a>

>“General relativity is certainly a very **beautiful theory**, but how does one judge the elegance of physical theories generally? 

>“One is left with the uneasy feeling that even if supersymmetry is actually false, as a feature of nature, and that accordingly no supersymmetry partners are ever found by the LHC or by any later more powerful accelerator, then the conclusion that some supersymmetry proponents might come to would not be that supersymmetry is false for the actual particles of nature, but merely that the level of supersymmetry breaking must be greater even that the level reached at that moment, and that a new even more powerful machine would be required to observe it!”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose" target="_blank">Roge Penrose</a>

>“All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" target="_blank">Galileo Galilei</a>

>“It is of great advantage to the student of any subject to read the original memoirs on that subject, for science is always most completely assimilated when it is in the nascent state...”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell" target="_blank">James Clerk Maxwell</a>

>“Physics is too hard for physicists.”<sup id="a5"><a href="#f5">5</a></sup>

>“But he (Galileo) was not an idiot,... **Only an idiot could believe that scientific truth needs martyrdom** — that may be necessary in religion, but scientific results prove themselves in time.”

>“If I were to awaken after having slept for a thousand years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?”

>“We must not believe those, who today, with philosophical bearing and deliberative tone, prophesy the fall of culture and accept the [ignorabimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoramus_et_ignorabimus). For us there is no ignorabimus, and in my opinion none whatever in natural science. In opposition to the foolish ignorabimus our slogan shall be:
>
>We must know — we will know!”<sup id="a6"><a href="#f6">6</a></sup>

>“No one shall expel us from the Paradise that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor" target="_blank">Cantor</a> has created.”

― <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Hilbert" target="_blank">David Hilbert</a>

>“I had no need of that hypothesis.” [When Napoleon said “Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe, and have never even mentioned its Creator”]

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace" target="_blank">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a>

>“It is a great pity that human beings cannot find all of their satisfaction in scientific contemplativeness.”

>“Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.”

>“It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about nature...”

>“Every sentence I utter must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question.”

>“I am absolutely prepared to talk about the spiritual life of an electronic computer: to state that it is reflecting or is in a bad mood... The question whether the machine really feels or ponders, or whether it merely looks as though it did, is of course absolutely meaningingless.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr" target="_blank">Niels Bohr</a>

>“I have done a terrible thing, I have postulated a particle that cannot be detected.”

>“I cannot believe God is a weak left-hander.” [After discovery of parity violation in 1956.]

>“This isn't right. This isn't even wrong.”

>“Against all the retrogressive endeavors (Bohm, Schrödinger etc. and in some sense also Einstein) I am sure that the statistical character of the ψ-function and hence of nature’s laws – on which you insisted from the very beginning against Schrödinger’s resistance – will define the style of the laws at least for some centuries. It may be that later, e.g. in connection with the living processes, one will find something entirely new, but to dream of a way back, back to the classical style of Newton-Maxwell (and these are just dreams these gentlemen are giving themselves up to) seems to me hopeless, digressive, bad taste. And, we could add, it is not even a beautiful dream.”

>“Einstein's conception [on God] is closer to mine. His God is somehow involved in the immutable laws of nature. Einstein has a feeling for the central order of things. He can detect it in the simplicity of natural laws. We may take it that he felt this simplicity very strongly and directly during his discovery of the theory of relativity. Admittedly, this is a far cry from the contents of religion. I don't believe Einstein is tied to any religious tradition, and I rather think the idea of a personal God is entirely foreign to him. But as far as he is concerned there is no split between science and religion: the central order is part of the subjective as well as the objective realm, and this strikes me as being a far better starting point.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Pauli" target="_blank">Wolfgang Pauli</a>

>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana" target="_blank">Nirvana</a> is a state of pure blissful knowledge... It has nothing to do with the individual. The ego or its separation is an illusion. Indeed in a certain sense two "I"'s are identical namely when one disregards all special contents — their Karma. The goal of man is to preserve his Karma and to develop it further... when man dies his Karma lives and creates for itself another carrier.”

>“In itself, the insight is not new. The earliest records, to my knowledge, date back some 2500 years or more... the recognition **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)" target="_blank">ATMAN</a> = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman" target="_blank">BRAHMAN</a>** (the personal self equals the omnipresent, all-comprehending eternal self) was in Indian thought considered, far from being blasphemous, to represent the quintessence of deepest insight into the happenings of the world. The striving of all the scholars of Vedanta was after having learnt to pronounce with their lips, really assimilate in their minds this grandest of all thoughts.
>
>Again, the mystics of many centuries, independently, yet in perfect harmony with each other (somewhat like the particles in an ideal gas) have described, each of them, the unique experience of his or her life in terms that can be condensed in the phrase: DEUS FACTUS SUM (I have become God).To Western ideology, the thought has remained a stranger...”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger" target="_blank">Erwin Schrödinger</a>

>“We have no right to assume that any physical laws exist, or if they have existed up to now, that they will continue to exist in a similar manner in the future.”

>“A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it ...”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck" target="_blank">Max Planck</a>

>“While it is never safe to affirm that the future of Physical Science has no marvels in store even more astonishing than those of the past, it seems probable that most of the grand underlying principles have been firmly established and that further advances are to be sought chiefly in the rigorous application of these principles to all the phenomena which come under our notice. It is here that the science of measurement shows its importance — where quantitative work is more to be desired than qualitative work. An eminent physicist remarked that the **future truths of physical science are to be looked for in the sixth place of decimals**.” 

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_A._Michelson" target="_blank">Albert A. Michelson</a> [1894]

>“I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”

>“I was born not knowing and have had only a **little time** to change that here and there.”

>“What one fool could understand, another can.”

>“From a long view of the history of mankind — seen from, say, ten thousand years from now — there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell's discovery of the laws of electrodynamics. The American Civil War will **pale** into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade.”

>“It doesn't seem to me that this fantastically marvellous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions, and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil — which is the view that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama.”

>“God was always invented to explain mystery. God is always invented to explain those things that you do not understand. Now when you finally discover how something works, you get some laws which you're taking away from God; you don't need him anymore. But you need him for the other mysteries. So therefore you leave him to create the universe because we haven't figured that out yet; you need him for understanding those things which you don't believe the laws will explain, such as consciousness, or why you only live to a certain length of time — life and death — stuff like that. God is always associated with those things that you do not understand. Therefore I don't think that the laws can be considered to be like God because they have been figured out.”

>“Einstein was a giant. His head was in the clouds, but his feet were on the ground. But those of us who are not that tall have to choose!”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a>

>“Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”

>“Be less curious about people and more curious about ideas.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie" target="_blank">Marie Curie</a>


>“In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.”

>“If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electron remains the same, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether the electron's position changes with time, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether the electron is at rest, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say 'no'. **The Buddha** has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of a man's self after his death; but they are not familiar answers for the tradition of seventeenth and eighteenth century science.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer" target="_blank">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>

>“It is just as foolish to complain that people are selfish and treacherous as it is to complain that the magnetic field does not increase unless the electric field has a curl. Both are laws of nature.”

>“Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann" target="_blank">John von Neumann</a>

>“A possible explanation of the physicist's use of mathematics to formulate his laws of nature is that he is a somewhat irresponsible person. As a result, when he finds a connection between two quantities which resembles a connection well-known from mathematics, he will jump at the conclusion that the connection is that discussed in mathematics simply because he does not know of any other similar connection.”

>“The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither ***understand*** nor ***deserve***.”

>“I have known a great many intelligent people in my life. I knew Planck, von Laue and Heisenberg. Paul Dirac was my brother in law; Leo Szilard and Edward Teller have been among my closest friends; and Albert Einstein was a good friend, too. But none of them had a mind as quick and acute as Jancsi [John] von Neumann. I have often remarked this in the presence of those men and no one ever disputed.
>
>But Einstein's understanding was deeper even than von Neumann's. His mind was both more penetrating and more original than von Neumann's. And that is a very remarkable statement. Einstein took an extraordinary pleasure in invention. Two of his greatest inventions are the Special and General Theories of Relativity; and for all of Jancsi's brilliance, he never produced anything as original.” 

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Wigner" target="_blank">Eugene Wigner</a>

>“This work contains many things which are new and interesting. Unfortunately, everything that is new is not interesting, and everything which is interesting, is not new.”

>“The theory of gravitational fields, constructed on the basis of the theory of relativity, is called the general theory of relativity. It was established by Einstein (and finally formulated by him in 1915), and represents probably the most beautiful of all existing physical theories. It is remarkable that it was developed by Einstein in a purely deductive manner and only later was substantiated by astronomical observations.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Landau" target="_blank">Lev Landau</a>

>“Niels Bohr brain-washed a whole generation of physicists into believing that the problem had been solved fifty years ago [comment on the Copenhagen interpretation].”

>“I thought of killing myself but soon decided that I could always try MIT and then kill myself later if it was that bad but that I couldn't commit suicide and then try MIT afterwards. The two operations, suicide and going to MIT, don't commute...”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann" target="_blank">Murray Gell-Mann</a>

>“The answer to the ancient question "Why is there something rather than nothing?" would then be that ‘nothing’ is unstable.”

>“Intelligent creatures that evolved to live deep within the atmosphere of a gas giant planet could be deluded, for eons, into thinking that the Universe is an approximately homogeneous expanse of gas, filling a three-dimensional space, but featuring anisotropic laws of motion (which we would ascribe to the planet’s gravitational field). Are we human scientists comparably blinkered?”

>“To put it crudely, theorists can be tempted to think along the lines “If people as clever as us haven’t explained it, that’s because it can’t be explained – it’s just an accident.” I believe there are at least two important regularities among standard model parameters that do have deeper explanations, namely the unification of couplings and the smallness of the QCD θ parameter. There may well be others.”

>“It is delightful in itself when we are able to interpret features of the present as signs confirming our understanding of the past.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wilczek" target="_blank">Frank Wilczek</a>

>“Remarkably, the building of the Standard Model — the theory of how particles and forces interact — was the success of the conservatives. It required no revolution at the foundational level. Normal physics, the kind that goes on experiment after experiment, produced the Standard Model.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gross" target="_blank">David Gross</a>

>“On your way towards becoming a bad theoretician, take your own immature theory, stop checking it for mistakes, don't listen to colleagues who do spot weaknesses, and start admiring your own infallible intelligence.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_%27t_Hooft" target="_blank">Gerard 't Hooft</a>

>“Physics is that subset of human experience which can be reduced to coupled harmonic oscillators”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Peskin" target="_blank">Michael Peskin</a>

>“I don't think that any physicist would have been clever enough to have invented string theory on purpose... Luckily, it was invented by accident.”

>“String theory is extremely attractive because gravity is forced upon us. All known consistent string theories include gravity, so while gravity is impossible in quantum field theory as we have known it, it is obligatory in string theory.”

>“It's been said that string theory is part of the physics of the twenty-first century that fell by chance into the twentieth century. That's a remark that was made by a leading physicist about fifteen years ago. ...String theory was invented essentially by accident in a long series of events, starting with the Veneziano model... No one invented it on purpose, it was invented in a lucky accident. ...By rights, string theory shouldn't have been invented until our knowledge of some of the areas that are prerequisite... had developed to the point that it was possible for us to have the right concept of what it is all about.”

>“Generally speaking, all the really great ideas of physics are really spin-offs of string theory... Some of them were discovered first, but I consider that a mere accident of the development on planet earth. On planet earth, they were discovered in this order [general relativity, quantum field theory, superstrings, and supersymmetry]... But I don't believe, if there are many civilizations in the universe, that those four ideas were discovered in that order in each civilization.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Witten" target="_blank">Edward Witten</a>

>“Elegance requires that the number of defining equations be small. Five is better than ten, and one is better than five. On this score, one might facetiously say that String Theory is the ultimate epitome of elegance. With all the years that String Theory has been studied, no one has found even a single defining equation! The number at present count is zero. We know neither what the fundamental equations of the theory are nor even if it has any.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind" target="_blank">Leonard Susskind</a>

>“In pre-relativistic mechanics, time is a special physical quantity, whose value is measured by physical clocks, that plays the role of the independent variable of physical evolution.”

>“In many cultures, the customary answer is that a God or Gods created the Universe out of nothing. But if we wish to pursue this question courageously, we must of course ask the next question: where did God come from? If we decide that this is an unanswerable question, why not save a step and conclude that the origin of the Universe is an unanswerable question? Or, if we say that God always existed, why not save a step, and conclude that the Universe always existed? That there's no need for a creation, it was always here. These are not easy questions. Cosmology brings us face to face with the deepest mysteries, questions that were once treated only in religion and myth.”

It is evident as a matter of logic that, since they disagree, not more than one of them can be true.

>“If everything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just as well be the world as God, so that there cannot be any validity in that argument.

I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for. We all know that at some point in the future the Universe will come to an end and at some other point, considerably in advance from that but still not immediately pressing, the sun will explode.

The expedition was successful, but he was disgusted by what be saw of the cruelties and horrors of war. He declared, in certain inscriptions that still exist, that he would no longer seek conquest by war, but by religion, and the rest of his life was devoted to the spreading of Buddhism throughout the world. He seems to have ruled his vast empire in peace and with great ability. **He was no mere religious fanatic. For eight and twenty years Asoka worked sanely for the real needs of men.** In the history of the world there have been thousands of kings and emperors who called themselves "their highnesses," "their majesties," and "their exalted majesties" and so on.

Yet such doubts don’t really change history much unless they have a practical impact on economics, politics and day-to-day life. Humans are masters of cognitive dissonance, and we allow ourselves to believe one thing in the laboratory and an altogether different thing in the courthouse or in parliament.

Buddha’s recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings.”

>“Understanding human history in the millennia following the Agricultural Revolution boils down to a single question: how did humans organise themselves in mass-cooperation networks, when they lacked the biological instincts necessary to sustain such networks?

>“Capitalism did not defeat communism because capitalism was more ethical, because individual liberties are sacred or because God was angry with the heathen communists. Rather, capitalism won the Cold War because distributed data processing works better than centralised data processing, at least in periods of accelerating technological change.

>“Today more than ninety per cent of all large animals are domesticated. Consider the chicken, for example. Ten thousand years ago it was a rare bird confined to small niches of South Asia. Today billions of chickens live on almost every continent and island, bar Antarctica. The domesticated chicken is probably the most widespread bird in the annals of planet Earth. If you measure success in terms of numbers, chickens, cows and pigs are the most successful animals ever. Alas, domesticated species paid for their unparalleled collective success with unprecedented individual suffering.”

>“Yet from the viewpoint of the herd, rather than that of the shepherd, it’s hard to avoid the impression that for the vast majority of domesticated animals, the Agricultural Revolution was a terrible catastrophe. Their evolutionary ‘success’ is meaningless. A rare wild rhinoceros on the brink of extinction is probably more satisfied than a calf who spends its short life inside a tiny box, fattened to produce juicy steaks. The contented rhinoceros is no less content for being among the last of its kind. The numerical success of the calf’s species is little consolation for the suffering the individual endures.”

#### Veganism

>“Our study [China–Cornell–Oxford Project: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted] suggests that the closer one approaches a total plant food diet, the greater the health benefit. … It turns out that animal protein, when consumed, exhibits a variety of undesirable health effects. Whether it is the immune system, various enzyme systems, the uptake of carcinogens into the cells, or hormonal activities, animal protein generally only causes mischief. High fat intake still can be a problem, and we ought not to be consuming such high-fat diets. But I suggest that animal protein is more problematic in this whole diet/disease relationship than is total fat.”

>“A global transition to a cruelty-free vegan diet won't just help non-human animals. The transition will also help malnourished humans who could benefit from the grain currently fed to factory-farmed animals. For factory-farming is not just cruel; it's energy-inefficient. Let’s take just one example. Over the past few decades, millions of Ethiopians have died of "food shortages" while Ethiopia grew grain to sell to the West to feed cattle. Western meat-eating habits prop up the price of grain so that poor people in the developing world can’t afford to buy it. In consequence, they starve by the millions. In my work, I explore futuristic, hi-tech solutions to the problem of suffering. But anybody who seriously wants to reduce human and non-human suffering alike should adopt a cruelty-free vegan lifestyle today.”

The mother was allowed to nurse her calf but for a single night. On the second day after birth, my uncle took the calf from the mother and placed him in the veal pen in the barn—only ten yards away, in plain view of the mother. The mother cow could see her infant, smell him, hear him, but could not touch him, comfort him, or nurse him. The heartrending bellows that she poured forth—minute after minute, hour after hour, for five long days—were excruciating to listen to. They are the most poignant and painful auditory memories I carry in my brain. Since that age, whenever I hear anyone postulate that animals cannot really feel emotions, I need only to replay that torturous sound in my memory of that mother cow crying her bovine heart out to her infant.

>“I had gone vegetarian when I was 11 because I was viscerally repelled by the idea of eating animal flesh and there was no way to avoid the fact that someone had been killed for that piece of meat. […] it took me until 2015 to become fully vegan. […] I think the root of this whole lifestyle is Compassion. It’s a daily reminder that we are all one. I believe veganism is what will heal this planet. […] I don’t know why we are still using our power and our blessings to quash animals. **Why have we not yet assumed our rightful role as their caretakers?** And every time I look into a cow’s eyes and see the gentle soul dwelling in that enormous powerful body, I feel like the animals are patiently waiting, quietly willing us to just catch on.”

>“I coined the term feminized protein for eggs and dairy products: plant protein produced through the abuse of the reproductive cycle of female animals. Feminized protein is taken from living female animals, whose reproductive capacity is manipulated for human needs. The unique situation of domesticated female animals required its own term: a sexual slavery with chickens in battery cages and dairy cows hooked up to milking machines. … The radical truth is that people can be perfectly happy as vegans, but the dominant culture can’t or won’t acknowledge this. … Being vegan is an exciting, wonderful culinary experience and we probably don’t even know what’s possible because it’s still so new. … The process of objectification/fragmentation/consumption can be interrupted by the process of attention/nowness/compassion.”

>“To protest about bullfighting in Spain, the eating of dogs in South Korea, or the slaughter of baby seals in Canada while continuing to eat eggs from hens who have spent their lives crammed into cages, or veal from calves who have been deprived of their mothers, their proper diet, and the freedom to lie down with their legs extended, is like denouncing apartheid in South Africa while asking your neighbours not to sell their houses to blacks.”

>“Those who claim to care about the wellbeing of human beings and the preservation of our environment should become vegetarians for that reason alone. They would thereby increase the amount of grain available to feed people elsewhere, reduce pollution, save water and energy, and cease contributing to the clearing of forests; moreover, since a vegetarian diet is cheaper than one based on meat dishes, they would have more money available to devote to famine relief, population control, or whatever social or political cause they thought most urgent. … when nonvegetarians say that “human problems come first” I cannot help wondering what exactly it is that they are doing for human beings that compels them to continue to support the wasteful, ruthless exploitation of farm animals.”

>“The animals themselves are incapable of demanding their own liberation, or of protesting against their condition with votes, demonstrations, or boycotts. Human beings have the power to continue to oppress other species forever, or until we make this planet unsuitable for living beings. Will our tyranny continue, proving that morality counts for nothing when it clashes with selfinterest, as the most cynical of poets and philosophers have always said? Or will we rise to the challenge and prove our capacity for genuine altruism by ending our ruthless exploitation of the species in our power, not because we are forced to do so by rebels or terrorists, but because we recognize that our position is morally indefensible? The way in which we answer this question depends on the way in which each one of us, individually, answers it.”

>“One common strategy on which we should all be able to agree is to take steps to reduce the risk of human extinction when those steps are also highly effective in benefiting existing sentient beings. For example, eliminating or decreasing the consumption of animal products will benefit animals, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lessen the chances of a pandemic resulting from a virus evolving among the animals crowded into today’s factory farms, which are an ideal breeding ground for viruses. That therefore looks like a high-priority strategy.”<sup id="a11"><a href="#f11">11</a></sup>

>“When we buy new clothes not to keep ourselves warm but to look "well-dressed" we are not providing for any important need. We would not be sacrificing anything significant if we were to continue to wear our old clothes, and give the money to famine relief. By doing so, we would be preventing another person from starving. It follows from what I have said earlier that we ought to give money away, rather than spend it on clothes which we do not need to keep us warm. To do so is not charitable, or generous. Nor is it the kind of act which philosophers and theologians have called "supererogatory" - an act which it would be good to do, but not wrong not to do. On the contrary, we ought to give the money away, and it is wrong not to do so.”

>“There can be no brotherhood when some nations indulge in previously unheard of luxuries, while others struggle to stave off famine.”

>“My students often ask me if I think their parents did wrong to pay the <span>$</span>44,000 per year that it costs to send them to Princeton. I respond that paying that much for a place at an elite university is not justified unless it is seen as an investment in the future that will benefit not only one’s child, but others as well. An outstanding education provides students with the skills, qualifications, and understanding to do more for the world than would otherwise be the case. It is good for the world as a whole if there are more people with these qualities. Even if going to Princeton does no more than open doors to jobs with higher salaries, that, too, is a benefit that can be spread to others, as long as after graduating you remain firm in the resolve to contribute a percentage of that salary to organizations working for the poor, and spread this idea among your highly paid colleagues. The danger, of course, is that your colleagues will instead persuade you that you can’t possibly drive anything less expensive than a BMW and that you absolutely must live in an impressively large apartment in one of the most expensive parts of town.”

>“September 11, 2001, was just another day for most of the world’s desperately poor people, so presumably close to 30,000 children under five died from these causes on that day—about ten times the number of victims of the terrorist attacks. The publication of these figures did not lead to an avalanche of money for UNICEF or other aid agencies helping to reduce infant mortality. In the year 2000 Americans made private donations for foreign aid of all kinds totalling about <span>$</span>4 per person in extreme poverty, or roughly <span>$</span>20 per family. New Yorkers who were living in lower Manhattan on September 11, 2001, whether wealthy or not, were able to receive an average of <span>$</span>5,300 per family. The distance between these amounts encapsulates the way in which, for many people, the circle of concern for others stops at the boundaries of their own country—if it extends even that far.”

<b id="f1">1)</b> I used to think he was a lazy guy. The quote is from <a href="https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol8-trans/176" target="_blank">this letter</a> written a week before he published correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations" target="_blank">field equations of General Relativity (GR) or EFE</a>. At that point of time he was very afraid that GR will be formulated by someone before him. Indeed it happened as he feared and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity_priority_dispute#Undisputed_facts" target="_blank">Hilbert probably found the correct field equations</a> ( $R_{\mu \nu }-{\frac {1}{2}}Rg_{\mu \nu }={\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }$ the cosmological constant came later) independently 5 days before him. Even if Hilbert actually found the complete equations before him, he would still be the <b>single biggest contributor</b> to the formulation of GR because he found the equations without the trace term(i.e. $R_{\mu \nu }={\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }$) first and was aware that he should add some term to make both sides consistent since $\nabla_{\nu} T^{\mu \nu}=0$ but $\nabla_{\nu} R^{\mu \nu }\neq 0$. Also Hilbert fully credited Einstein as the originator of the theory and no public priority dispute concerning the field equations ever arose between the two men during their lives.<a href="#a1">↩</a>

<b id="f2">2)</b> This was Newton's response whenever <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley" target="_blank">Edmond Halley</a> mocked religion or alchemy. Newton said [on atheism]:

>“Atheism is so senseless & odious to mankind that it never had many professors. Can it be by accident that all birds beasts & men have their right side & left side alike shaped (except in their bowels) & just two eyes & no more on either side the face & just two ears on either side the head & a nose with two holes & no more between the eyes & one mouth under the nose & either two fore leggs or two wings or two arms on the sholders & two leggs on the hipps one on either side & no more? Whence arises this uniformity in all their outward shapes but from the counsel & contrivance of an Author? Whence is it that the eyes of all sorts of living creatures are transparent to the very bottom & the only transparent members in the body, having on the outside an hard transparent skin, & within transparent juyces with a crystalline Lens in the middle & a pupil before the Lens all of them so truly shaped & fitted for vision, that no Artist can mend them? Did blind chance know that there was light & what was its refraction & fit the eyes of all creatures after the most curious manner to make use of it? These & such like considerations always have & ever will prevail with man kind to believe that there is a being who made all things & has all things in his power & who is therfore to be feared.”

Newton is widely considered as one of the top 2 physicists of all time (the other being Einstein. Example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Landau#Landau's_ranking_of_physicists" target="_blank">Landau's ranking of physicists</a>). You may ask: 'How could someone that intelligent believe in something as silly as religion?'. But we should understand that those questions above were unexplainable back in those days as **biology was not mature enough** to answer them. So, **Newton had valid excuses to utter such nonsense**. He also believed in Alchemy and <a href="https://www.livescience.com/54162-newton-recipe-for-philosophers-stone-rediscovered.html" target="_blank">was interested in making the philosophers stone</a>. To be honest if I believed that philosophers stone can exist, I would also definitely try to make it and become **immortal**.

>Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind that looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10 000 years ago.”

Often times some people people misinterpret this quote to portray Buddhism as a religion based on logic, even though Buddha stated that one should not determine the validity of a statement "by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought". When dealing with scientific theories logic should be given at most importance. But Buddha is not talking about scientific truths, he is talking about morality. Based on science and logic it is strongly evident that there is no such thing as free will. This doesn't mean we should forget about morality.
