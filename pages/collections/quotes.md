### Physicists

>“I worked horribly strenuously, strange that one can endure that.”<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>

>“People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a **stubbornly persistent illusion.**”

>“I believe with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank">Schopenhauer</a>: ***We can do what we wish, but we can only wish what we must***. Practically, I am, nevertheless, compelled to act as if freedom of the will existed. If I wish to live in a civilized community, I must act as if man is a responsible being. I know that philosophically a murderer is not responsible for his crime; nevertheless, I must protect myself from unpleasant contacts. I may consider him guiltless, but I prefer not to take tea with him.”

>“It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. **I do not believe in a personal God** and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.”

>“I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modelled after our own — a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbour such thoughts through **fear or ridiculous egotisms**.”

>“Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank">Albert Einstein</a>

>“Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler" target="_blank">John Archibald Wheeler</a>

>“If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9" target="_blank">Henri Poincaré</a>

>“Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ...”

>“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.”

>“To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. 'Tis much better to do a little with certainty, & leave the rest for others that come after you, than to explain all things by conjecture without making sure of any thing.”

>“I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.”

>“I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses; for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called a hypothesis, and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy.”

>“I have studied these things — you have not.”<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">Isaac Newton</a>

>“Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. ***What one fool can do, another can.***”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvanus_P._Thompson" target="_blank">Silvanus P. Thompson</a>

>“The black holes of nature are **the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe**: the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time. And since the general theory of Relativity provides only a single unique family of solutions for their descriptions, they are the simplest objects as well.”<sup id="a3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar" target="_blank">Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</a>

>“Black holes ain't as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought. Things can get out of a black hole, both to the outside, and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up. There's a way out.”

>“We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can **understand the Universe**. That makes us something very special.”

>“I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first ... I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.”

>“I used to think that information was destroyed in black holes. But the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdS/CFT_correspondence" target="_blank">AdS/CFT correspondence</a> led me to change my mind. This was my biggest blunder, or at least my biggest blunder in science.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" target="_blank">Stephen Hawking</a>

>“I cannot understand why we idle discussing **religion**. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of **false assertions**, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why **primitive people**, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling.
>
>But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the **postulate** of an **Almighty God** helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit.
>
>Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of **all mortal sins**.”<sup id="a4"><a href="#f4">4</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac" target="_blank">P.A.M Dirac</a>

>“Religion is an insult to **human dignity**. Without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.But for good people to do evil things, that takes **religion**.”

>“I think the world needs to wake up from its long nightmare of religious belief; and anything that we scientists can do to ***weaken the hold of religion*** should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.

>“I have a friend — or had a friend, now dead — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam" target="_blank">Abdus Salam</a>, a very devout Muslim, who was trying to bring science into the universities in the Gulf states and he told me that he had a terrible time because, although they were very receptive to technology, they felt that science would be a corrosive to religious belief, and they were worried about it... and damn it, I think they were right. ***It is corrosive of religious belief, and it's a good thing too***.”

>“The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more **it also seems pointless**.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg" target="_blank">Steven Weinberg</a>

>“All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" target="_blank">Galileo Galilei</a>

>“It is of great advantage to the student of any subject to read the original memoirs on that subject, for science is always most completely assimilated when it is in the nascent state...”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell" target="_blank">James Clerk Maxwell</a>

>“Physics is too hard for physicists.”<sup id="a5"><a href="#f5">5</a></sup>

>“But he (Galileo) was not an idiot,... **Only an idiot could believe that scientific truth needs martyrdom** — that may be necessary in religion, but scientific results prove themselves in time.”

>“If I were to awaken after having slept for a thousand years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?”

>“We must not believe those, who today, with philosophical bearing and deliberative tone, prophesy the fall of culture and accept the [ignorabimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoramus_et_ignorabimus). For us there is no ignorabimus, and in my opinion none whatever in natural science. In opposition to the foolish ignorabimus our slogan shall be:
>
>We must know — we will know!”<sup id="a6"><a href="#f6">6</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Hilbert" target="_blank">David Hilbert</a>

>“I had no need of that hypothesis.” [When Napoleon said “Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe, and have never even mentioned its Creator”]

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace" target="_blank">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a>

>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana" target="_blank">Nirvana</a> is a state of pure blissful knowledge... It has nothing to do with the individual. The ego or its separation is an illusion. Indeed in a certain sense two "I"'s are identical namely when one disregards all special contents — their Karma. The goal of man is to preserve his Karma and to develop it further... when man dies his Karma lives and creates for itself another carrier.”

>“In itself, the insight is not new. The earliest records, to my knowledge, date back some 2500 years or more... the recognition **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)" target="_blank">ATMAN</a> = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman" target="_blank">BRAHMAN</a>** (the personal self equals the omnipresent, all-comprehending eternal self) was in Indian thought considered, far from being blasphemous, to represent the quintessence of deepest insight into the happenings of the world. The striving of all the scholars of Vedanta was after having learnt to pronounce with their lips, really assimilate in their minds this grandest of all thoughts.
>
>Again, the mystics of many centuries, independently, yet in perfect harmony with each other (somewhat like the particles in an ideal gas) have described, each of them, the unique experience of his or her life in terms that can be condensed in the phrase: DEUS FACTUS SUM (I have become God).To Western ideology, the thought has remained a stranger...”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger" target="_blank">Erwin Schrödinger</a>

>“I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.”

>“I was born not knowing and have had only a **little time** to change that here and there.”

>“From a long view of the history of mankind — seen from, say, ten thousand years from now — there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell's discovery of the laws of electrodynamics. The American Civil War will **pale** into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade.”

>“It doesn't seem to me that this fantastically marvellous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions, and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil — which is the view that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama.”

>“God was always invented to explain mystery. God is always invented to explain those things that you do not understand. Now when you finally discover how something works, you get some laws which you're taking away from God; you don't need him anymore. But you need him for the other mysteries. So therefore you leave him to create the universe because we haven't figured that out yet; you need him for understanding those things which you don't believe the laws will explain, such as consciousness, or why you only live to a certain length of time — life and death — stuff like that. God is always associated with those things that you do not understand. Therefore I don't think that the laws can be considered to be like God because they have been figured out.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a>

>“Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie" target="_blank">Marie Curie</a>


>“In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.”

>“If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electron remains the same, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether the electron's position changes with time, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether the electron is at rest, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say 'no'. **The Buddha** has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of a man's self after his death; but they are not familiar answers for the tradition of seventeenth and eighteenth century science.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer" target="_blank">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>

>“It is just as foolish to complain that people are selfish and treacherous as it is to complain that the magnetic field does not increase unless the electric field has a curl. Both are laws of nature.”

>“Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann" target="_blank">John von Neumann</a>

>“A possible explanation of the physicist's use of mathematics to formulate his laws of nature is that he is a somewhat irresponsible person. As a result, when he finds a connection between two quantities which resembles a connection well-known from mathematics, he will jump at the conclusion that the connection is that discussed in mathematics simply because he does not know of any other similar connection.”

>“The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither ***understand*** nor ***deserve***.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Wigner" target="_blank">Eugene Wigner</a>

>“It is a great pity that human beings cannot find all of their satisfaction in scientific contemplativeness.”

>“It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about nature...”

>“Every sentence I utter must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question.”

>“I am absolutely prepared to talk about the spiritual life of an electronic computer: to state that it is reflecting or is in a bad mood... The question whether the machine really feels or ponders, or whether it merely looks as though it did, is of course absolutely meaningingless.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr" target="_blank">Niels Bohr</a>

>“Niels Bohr brain-washed a whole generation of physicists into believing that the problem had been solved fifty years ago [comment on the Copenhagen interpretation].”

>“I thought of killing myself but soon decided that I could always try MIT and then kill myself later if it was that bad but that I couldn't commit suicide and then try MIT afterwards. The two operations, suicide and going to MIT, don't commute...”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann" target="_blank">Murray Gell-Mann</a>

>“The answer to the ancient question "Why is there something rather than nothing?" would then be that ‘nothing’ is unstable.”

>“Intelligent creatures that evolved to live deep within the atmosphere of a gas giant planet could be deluded, for eons, into thinking that the Universe is an approximately homogeneous expanse of gas, filling a three-dimensional space, but featuring anisotropic laws of motion (which we would ascribe to the planet’s gravitational field). Are we human scientists comparably blinkered?”

>“To put it crudely, theorists can be tempted to think along the lines “If people as clever as us haven’t explained it, that’s because it can’t be explained – it’s just an accident.” I believe there are at least two important regularities among standard model parameters that do have deeper explanations, namely the unification of couplings and the smallness of the QCD θ parameter. There may well be others.”

>“It is delightful in itself when we are able to interpret features of the present as signs confirming our understanding of the past.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Wilczek" target="_blank">Frank Wilczek</a>

>“Remarkably, the building of the Standard Model — the theory of how particles and forces interact — was the success of the conservatives. It required no revolution at the foundational level. Normal physics, the kind that goes on experiment after experiment, produced the Standard Model.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gross" target="_blank">David Gross</a>

>“On your way towards becoming a bad theoretician, take your own immature theory, stop checking it for mistakes, don't listen to colleagues who do spot weaknesses, and start admiring your own infallible intelligence.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_%27t_Hooft" target="_blank">Gerard 't Hooft</a>

>“I don't think that any physicist would have been clever enough to have invented string theory on purpose... Luckily, it was invented by accident.”

>“String theory is extremely attractive because gravity is forced upon us. All known consistent string theories include gravity, so while gravity is impossible in quantum field theory as we have known it, it is obligatory in string theory.”

>“It's been said that string theory is part of the physics of the twenty-first century that fell by chance into the twentieth century. That's a remark that was made by a leading physicist about fifteen years ago. ...String theory was invented essentially by accident in a long series of events, starting with the Veneziano model... No one invented it on purpose, it was invented in a lucky accident. ...By rights, string theory shouldn't have been invented until our knowledge of some of the areas that are prerequisite... had developed to the point that it was possible for us to have the right concept of what it is all about.”

>“Generally speaking, all the really great ideas of physics are really spin-offs of string theory... Some of them were discovered first, but I consider that a mere accident of the development on planet earth. On planet earth, they were discovered in this order [general relativity, quantum field theory, superstrings, and supersymmetry]... But I don't believe, if there are many civilizations in the universe, that those four ideas were discovered in that order in each civilization.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Witten" target="_blank">Edward Witten</a>

>“Elegance requires that the number of defining equations be small. Five is better than ten, and one is better than five. On this score, one might facetiously say that String Theory is the ultimate epitome of elegance. With all the years that String Theory has been studied, no one has found even a single defining equation! The number at present count is zero. We know neither what the fundamental equations of the theory are nor even if it has any.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Susskind" target="_blank">Leonard Susskind</a>

>“In pre-relativistic mechanics, time is a special physical quantity, whose value is measured by physical clocks, that plays the role of the independent variable of physical evolution.”

>“Time is... the expression of our ignorance of the full microstate.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rovelli" target="_blank">Carlo Rovelli</a>

>“The question of the origin of the matter in the universe is no longer thought to be beyond the range of science — everything can be created from nothing…it is fair to say that the universe is the ultimate free lunch.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Guth" target="_blank">Alan Guth</a>

>“The Big Bang is the poor man's particle accelerator.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Zeldovich" target="_blank">Yakov Zeldovich</a>

>“Perhaps I may claim as evidence for progress in religion the fact that we no longer burn heretics.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson" target="_blank">Freeman Dyson</a>

>“There are countless suns and countless earths all rotating round their suns in exactly the same way as the seven planets of our system.”

>“You may be more afraid to bring that sentence against me than I am to accept it.”<sup id="a7"><a href="#f7">7</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno" target="_blank">Giordano Bruno</a>

>“The behavior of large and complex aggregates of elementary particles, it turns out, is not to be understood in terms of a simple extrapolation of a few particles. Instead, at each level of complexity entirely new properties appear, and the understanding of the new behaviors requires research which I think is as fundamental in its nature as any other.”

>“Of course I am not religious—I don’t in fact see how any scientist who thinks at all deeply can be so ...”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_W._Anderson" target="_blank">Philip W. Anderson</a>

>“If I were forced to sum up in one sentence what the Copenhagen interpretation says to me, it would be 'Shut up and calculate!'”

>“Question: What is the difference between theoretical physics and mathematical physics?<br>
Answer: Theoretical physics is done by physicists who lack the necessary skills to do real experiments; mathematical physics is done by mathematicians who lack the necessary skills to do real mathematics.<br>
Mathematical physicists tend not to like this joke, but other physicists seem to. Nonphysicists, of course, are entirely immune to its charms.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mermin" target="_blank">N. David Mermin</a>

>“Science flies you to the moon. Religion flies you into buildings.”

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/pbdot.jpeg "Pale blue dot")
>“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of **confident religions**, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
>
>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a **fraction of a dot**.
>
>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
>
>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.
>
>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores ***our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot***, the only home we've ever known.”

### Philosophers

>“**Desires** are the root cause of **sadness**.”<sup id="a8"><a href="#f8">8</a></sup>

>“I say that there are three instances in which meat should not be consumed: when it is seen, heard, or suspected [that the animal was killed for one’s sake]. These are the three instances in which I say that meat should not be consumed.”

>“How then can it be compassionate to gorge on other beings’ blood and flesh? Monks who will not wear silks from the East, whether coarse or fine; who will not wear shoes or boots of leather, nor furs, nor birds’ down from our own country; and who will not consume milk, curds, or ghee, have truly freed themselves from the world.”

>“Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.”

>“Now, Kalamas,<br>
Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing (anussava),<br>
nor upon tradition (paramparā),<br>
nor upon rumor (itikirā),<br>
nor upon what is in a scripture (piṭaka-sampadāna),<br>
nor upon surmise (takka-hetu),<br>
nor upon an axiom (naya-hetu),<br>
nor upon specious reasoning (ākāra-parivitakka),<br>
nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over (diṭṭhi-nijjhān-akkh-antiyā),<br>
nor upon another's seeming ability (bhabba-rūpatāya),<br>
nor upon the consideration, The monk is our teacher (samaṇo no garū).<br>
Kalamas, when you yourselves know: "These things are good; these things are not blamable; these things are praised by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness," enter on and abide in them.”<sup id="a9"><a href="#f9">9</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha" target="_blank">Gautama Buddha</a> (I do not support main stream ***unscientific*** Buddhism. You can read my views on religion <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2020/05/views-on-religion.html" target="_blank">here</a>.)

>“Skepticism, while logically impeccable, is psychologically impossible, and there is an element of frivolous insincerity in any philosophy which pretends to accept it.”

>“If there were a God, I think it very unlikely that he would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt his existence.”

>“I think all the great religions of the world - Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, and Communism - both untrue and harmful. It is evident as a matter of logic that, since they disagree, not more than one of them can be true. With very few exception, the religions which a man accepts is that of the community in which he lives, which makes it obvious that the influence of environment is what has led him to accept the religion in question.”

>“If everything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just as well be the world as God, so that there cannot be any validity in that argument. It is exactly of the same nature as the Hindu's view, that the world rested upon an elephant and the elephant rested upon a tortoise; and when they said, "How about the tortoise?" the Indian said, "Suppose we change the subject." The argument is really no better than that.”

>“Quite illogically, the victory of Locke’s philosophy in England and France was largely due to the prestige of Newton. Descartes’ authority as a philosopher was enhanced, in his own day, by his work in mathematics and natural philosophy. But his doctrine of vortices was definitely inferior to Newton’s law of gravitation as an explanation of the solar system. The victory of the Newtonian cosmogony diminished men’s respect for Descartes and increased their respect for England. Both these causes inclined men favourably towards Locke.”

>“In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge the governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%E2%80%93Einstein_Manifesto" target="_blank">Russell–Einstein Manifesto</a>)

>“If a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will refuse to believe it. If, on the other hand, he is offered something which affords a reason for acting in accordance with his instincts, he will accept it even on the slenderest evidence. The origin of myths is explained in this way.”

>“I like mathematics because it is not human and has nothing particular to do with this planet or with the whole accidental universe – because, like Spinoza's God, it won't love us in return.”

>“One of the painful things about our time is that those who feel certainty are stupid, and those with any imagination and understanding are filled with doubt and indecision.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" target="_blank">Bertrand Russell</a>

>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus" target="_blank">Epicurus</a>’s old questions are yet unanswered. Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?”

>“Ignorance is the mother of Devotion.”

The expedition was successful, but he was disgusted by what be saw of the cruelties and horrors of war. He declared, in certain inscriptions that still exist, that he would no longer seek conquest by war, but by religion, and the rest of his life was devoted to the spreading of Buddhism throughout the world. He seems to have ruled his vast empire in peace and with great ability. **He was no mere religious fanatic.

Yet such doubts don’t really change history much unless they have a practical impact on economics, politics and day-to-day life. Humans are masters of cognitive dissonance, and we allow ourselves to believe one thing in the laboratory and an altogether different thing in the courthouse or in parliament.

Today billions of chickens live on almost every continent and island, bar Antarctica. The domesticated chicken is probably the most widespread bird in the annals of planet Earth. If you measure success in terms of numbers, chickens, cows and pigs are the most successful animals ever. Alas, domesticated species paid for their unparalleled collective success with unprecedented individual suffering.”

>“Yet from the viewpoint of the herd, rather than that of the shepherd, it’s hard to avoid the impression that for the vast majority of domesticated animals, the Agricultural Revolution was a terrible catastrophe. Their evolutionary ‘success’ is meaningless. A rare wild rhinoceros on the brink of extinction is probably more satisfied than a calf who spends its short life inside a tiny box, fattened to produce juicy steaks. The contented rhinoceros is no less content for being among the last of its kind. The numerical success of the calf’s species is little consolation for the suffering the individual endures.”

#### Veganism

>“Our study [China–Cornell–Oxford Project: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted] suggests that the closer one approaches a total plant food diet, the greater the health benefit. … It turns out that animal protein, when consumed, exhibits a variety of undesirable health effects. Whether it is the immune system, various enzyme systems, the uptake of carcinogens into the cells, or hormonal activities, animal protein generally only causes mischief. High fat intake still can be a problem, and we ought not to be consuming such high-fat diets. But I suggest that animal protein is more problematic in this whole diet/disease relationship than is total fat.”

>“A global transition to a cruelty-free vegan diet won't just help non-human animals. The transition will also help malnourished humans who could benefit from the grain currently fed to factory-farmed animals. For factory-farming is not just cruel; it's energy-inefficient. Let’s take just one example. Over the past few decades, millions of Ethiopians have died of "food shortages" while Ethiopia grew grain to sell to the West to feed cattle. Western meat-eating habits prop up the price of grain so that poor people in the developing world can’t afford to buy it. In consequence, they starve by the millions. In my work, I explore futuristic, hi-tech solutions to the problem of suffering. But anybody who seriously wants to reduce human and non-human suffering alike should adopt a cruelty-free vegan lifestyle today.”

Climate change would decrease by 25 percent, deforestation would cease, rainforests would be preserved, our water- and air-quality would increase, life-expectancy rates would increase, and our rates of cancer would plummet, so certainly, with that one action of becoming vegan you are quite effectively making the world a better place.”

>“Many years ago, when I was **merely** a vegetarian, I met the great Cesar Chavez, and he said to me: "If you are interested in preventing animal suffering, the first thing you should give up is eggs and milk, because the animals who produce those foods lead the most unhappy lives. You would do better to eat meat and stop eating eggs and dairy products." I was shocked, since I had no intention of eating meat but had never thought of giving up eggs or dairy products. But when I looked into it I realized he was right, and now, years later, after I have studied the matter up close, I know for certain that he was completely correct about the cruel treatment of the animals raised for such products. The advantages of a vegan diet are enormous for our health, for the environment, for the animals themselves.”

>“The human body has no more need for cows' milk than it does for dogs' milk, horses' milk, or giraffes' milk.”

>“The very saddest sound in all my memory was burned into my awareness at age five on my uncle's dairy farm in Wisconsin. A cow had given birth to a beautiful male calf. The mother was allowed to nurse her calf but for a single night. On the second day after birth, my uncle took the calf from the mother and placed him in the veal pen in the barn—only ten yards away, in plain view of the mother. The mother cow could see her infant, smell him, hear him, but could not touch him, comfort him, or nurse him. The heartrending bellows that she poured forth—minute after minute, hour after hour, for five long days—were excruciating to listen to. They are the most poignant and painful auditory memories I carry in my brain. Since that age, whenever I hear anyone postulate that animals cannot really feel emotions, I need only to replay that torturous sound in my memory of that mother cow crying her bovine heart out to her infant. Mother's love knows no species barriers, and I believe that all people who are vegans in their hearts and souls know that to be true.”

>“One of the main arguments that I make is that although almost everyone accepts that it is morally wrong to inflict "unnecessary" suffering and death on animals, 99% of the suffering and death that we inflict on animals can be justified only by our pleasure, amusement, or convenience. For example, the best justification that we have for killing the billions of nonhumans that we eat every year is that we enjoy the taste of animal flesh and animal products. This is not an acceptable justification if we take seriously, as we purport to, that it is wrong to inflict unnecessary suffering or death on animals, and it illustrates the confused thinking that I characterize as our "moral schizophrenia" when it comes to nonhumans.”

>“I think, whether we’re talking about gender inequality or racism or queer rights or indigenous rights or animal rights, we’re talking about the fight against injustice. We’re talking about the fight against the belief that one nation, one people, one race, one gender, one species, has the right to dominate, use and control another with impunity. I think we’ve become very disconnected from the natural world. Many of us are guilty of an egocentric world view, and we believe that we’re the centre of the universe. We go into the natural world and we plunder it for its resources. We feel entitled to artificially inseminate a cow and steal her baby, even though her cries of anguish are unmistakeable. Then we take her milk that’s intended for her calf and we put it in our coffee and our cereal. We fear the idea of personal change, because we think we need to sacrifice something; to give something up. But human beings at our best are so creative and inventive, and we can create, develop and implement systems of change that are beneficial to all sentient beings and the environment.”

Feminized protein is taken from living female animals, whose reproductive capacity is manipulated for human needs. The unique situation of domesticated female animals required its own term: a sexual slavery with chickens in battery cages and dairy cows hooked up to milking machines. … The radical truth is that people can be perfectly happy as vegans, but the dominant culture can’t or won’t acknowledge this. … Being vegan is an exciting, wonderful culinary experience and we probably don’t even know what’s possible because it’s still so new. … The process of objectification/fragmentation/consumption can be interrupted by the process of attention/nowness/compassion.”

>“Those who claim to care about the wellbeing of human beings and the preservation of our environment should become vegetarians for that reason alone. They would thereby increase the amount of grain available to feed people elsewhere, reduce pollution, save water and energy, and cease contributing to the clearing of forests; moreover, since a vegetarian diet is cheaper than one based on meat dishes, they would have more money available to devote to famine relief, population control, or whatever social or political cause they thought most urgent. … when nonvegetarians say that “human problems come first” I cannot help wondering what exactly it is that they are doing for human beings that compels them to continue to support the wasteful, ruthless exploitation of farm animals.”

>“The animals themselves are incapable of demanding their own liberation, or of protesting against their condition with votes, demonstrations, or boycotts. Human beings have the power to continue to oppress other species forever, or until we make this planet unsuitable for living beings. Will our tyranny continue, proving that morality counts for nothing when it clashes with selfinterest, as the most cynical of poets and philosophers have always said? Or will we rise to the challenge and prove our capacity for genuine altruism by ending our ruthless exploitation of the species in our power, not because we are forced to do so by rebels or terrorists, but because we recognize that our position is morally indefensible? The way in which we answer this question depends on the way in which each one of us, individually, answers it.”

>“One common strategy on which we should all be able to agree is to take steps to reduce the risk of human extinction when those steps are also highly effective in benefiting existing sentient beings. For example, eliminating or decreasing the consumption of animal products will benefit animals, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lessen the chances of a pandemic resulting from a virus evolving among the animals crowded into today’s factory farms, which are an ideal breeding ground for viruses. That therefore looks like a high-priority strategy.”<sup id="a11"><a href="#f11">11</a></sup>

>“When we buy new clothes not to keep ourselves warm but to look "well-dressed" we are not providing for any important need. We would not be sacrificing anything significant if we were to continue to wear our old clothes, and give the money to famine relief. By doing so, we would be preventing another person from starving. It follows from what I have said earlier that we ought to give money away, rather than spend it on clothes which we do not need to keep us warm. To do so is not charitable, or generous. Nor is it the kind of act which philosophers and theologians have called "supererogatory" - an act which it would be good to do, but not wrong not to do. On the contrary, we ought to give the money away, and it is wrong not to do so.”

>“There can be no brotherhood when some nations indulge in previously unheard of luxuries, while others struggle to stave off famine.”

>“My students often ask me if I think their parents did wrong to pay the $44,000 per year that it costs to send them to Princeton. I respond that paying that much for a place at an elite university is not justified unless it is seen as an investment in the future that will benefit not only one’s child, but others as well. An outstanding education provides students with the skills, qualifications, and understanding to do more for the world than would otherwise be the case. It is good for the world as a whole if there are more people with these qualities. Even if going to Princeton does no more than open doors to jobs with higher salaries, that, too, is a benefit that can be spread to others, as long as after graduating you remain firm in the resolve to contribute a percentage of that salary to organizations working for the poor, and spread this idea among your highly paid colleagues. The danger, of course, is that your colleagues will instead persuade you that you can’t possibly drive anything less expensive than a BMW and that you absolutely must live in an impressively large apartment in one of the most expensive parts of town.”

>“September 11, 2001, was just another day for most of the world’s desperately poor people, so presumably close to 30,000 children under five died from these causes on that day—about ten times the number of victims of the terrorist attacks. The publication of these figures did not lead to an avalanche of money for UNICEF or other aid agencies helping to reduce infant mortality. In the year 2000 Americans made private donations for foreign aid of all kinds totalling about $4 per person in extreme poverty, or roughly $20 per family. New Yorkers who were living in lower Manhattan on September 11, 2001, whether wealthy or not, were able to receive an average of $5,300 per family. The distance between these amounts encapsulates the way in which, for many people, the circle of concern for others stops at the boundaries of their own country—if it extends even that far.”

<b id="f1">1)</b> I used to think he was a lazy guy.

At that point of time he was very afraid that GR will be formulated by someone before him. Indeed it happened as he feared and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity_priority_dispute#Undisputed_facts" target="_blank">Hilbert probably found the correct field equations</a> ( $R_{\mu \nu }-{\frac {1}{2}}Rg_{\mu \nu }={\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }$ the cosmological constant came later) independently 5 days before him. Even if Hilbert actually found the complete equations before him, he would still be the <b>single biggest contributor</b> to the formulation of GR because he found the equations without the trace term(i.e. $R_{\mu \nu }={\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }$) first and was aware that he should add some term to make both sides consistent since $\nabla_{\nu} T^{\mu \nu}=0$ but $\nabla_{\nu} R^{\mu \nu }\neq 0$. Also Hilbert fully credited Einstein as the originator of the theory and no public priority dispute concerning the field equations ever arose between the two men during their lives.<a href="#a1">↩</a>

Whence arises this uniformity in all their outward shapes but from the counsel & contrivance of an Author? Whence is it that the eyes of all sorts of living creatures are transparent to the very bottom & the only transparent members in the body, having on the outside an hard transparent skin, & within transparent juyces with a crystalline Lens in the middle & a pupil before the Lens all of them so truly shaped & fitted for vision, that no Artist can mend them? Did blind chance know that there was light & what was its refraction & fit the eyes of all creatures after the most curious manner to make use of it? These & such like considerations always have & ever will prevail with man kind to believe that there is a being who made all things & has all things in his power & who is therfore to be feared.”*<br>
