### Physicists

>“The scientist does not study nature because it is useful to do so. He studies it because he takes pleasure in it, and he takes pleasure in it because it is beautiful. ***If nature were not beautiful it would not be worth knowing, and life would not be worth living***. I am not speaking, of course, of the beauty which strikes the senses, of the beauty of qualities and appearances. I am far from despising this, but it has nothing to do with science. What I mean is that more intimate beauty which comes from the harmonious order of its parts, and which a pure intelligence can grasp.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9" target="_blank">Henri Poincaré</a>

>“Mathematics was not sufficiently refined in 1917 to cleave apart the demands for **"no prior geometry"** and for a geometric, coordinate-independent formulation of physics. Einstein described both demands by a single phrase, "general covariance". The "no prior geometry" demand actually fathered general relativity, but by doing so anonymously, disguised as "general covariance", it also fathered half a century of confusion.”

>“Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.”

>“Behind it all is surely an idea so simple, so beautiful, that when we grasp it — in a decade, a century, or a millennium — we will all say to each other, how could it have been otherwise? How could we have been so stupid for so long?”

>“**It from bit**. Otherwise put, every it — every particle, every field of force, even the space-time continuum itself — derives its function, its meaning, its very existence entirely — even if in some contexts indirectly — from the apparatus-elicited answers to yes-or-no questions, binary choices, bits. It from bit symbolizes the idea that every item of the physical world has at bottom — at a very deep bottom, in most instances — an immaterial source and explanation; that which we call reality arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions and the registering of equipment-evoked responses; in short, that **all things physical are information-theoretic in origin** and that this is a participatory universe.”[1990]

>“There is a famous saying about quantization due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Nelson" target="_blank">Edward Nelson</a>: "First quantization is a mystery, but second quantization is a functor!" No one is a true mathematical physicist unless they can explain that remark. So, let me explain that remark!
>
>First quantization is a mystery. It is the attempt to get from a classical description of a physical system to a quantum description of the "same" system. Now it doesn't seem to be true that God created a classical universe on the first day and then quantized it on the second day. So it's unnatural to try to get from classical to quantum mechanics. Nonetheless we are inclined to do so since we understand classical mechanics better. So we'd like to find a way to start with a classical mechanics problem - that is, a phase space and a Hamiltonian function on it - and cook up a quantum mechanics problem - that is, a Hilbert space with a Hamiltonian operator on it. It has become clear that there is no utterly general systematic procedure for doing so.
>
>Mathematically, if quantization were "natural" it would be a functor from the category whose objects are symplectic manifolds (= phase spaces) and whose morphisms are symplectic maps (= canonical transformations) to the category whose objects are Hilbert spaces and whose morphisms are unitary operators. Alas, there is no such nice functor. So quantization is always an ad hoc and problematic thing to attempt. A lot is known about it, but more isn't. That's why first quantization is a mystery.
>
>Second quantization is the attempt to get from a quantum description of a single-particle system to a quantum description of a many-particle system. (There are other ways to think of it, but let's do it this way.) Starting from a Hilbert space H for the single particle system, one forms the symmetric (or antisymmetric) tensor algebra over H and completes it to form a Hilbert space K, called the bosonic (or fermionic) Fock space over H. Any unitary operator on H gives a unitary operator on K in an obvious way. More generally, one has a functor called "second quantization" from the Hilbert category to itself, which sends each Hilbert space to its Fock space, and each unitary map to an obvious unitary map. This functor is positivity-preserving. (All the weird problems with negative-energy states of the electron, Dirac's "holes in the electron sea," and such, are due to thinking about things the wrong way.)”

>“In these last months I had great success in my work. Generally covariant gravitation equations. Perihelion motions explained quantitatively. The role of gravitation in the structure of matter. You will be astonished. I worked **horribly strenuously, strange that one can endure that**.”[17 November 1915 Einstein's mail to Michele Besso][^EinsteinNotLazy]

>“Imagine my joy at the feasibility of general covariance and the result that the equations give the perihelion motion of Mercury correctly. For a few days I was beside myself with joyous excitement.”[to Ehrenfest]

>“My wildest dreams have been fulfilled. General covariance. Perihelion motion of Mercury wonderfully exact.”[10 December 1915 Einstein's mail to Michele Besso]

>“You must not be cross with me that I am answering your kind and interesting letter only today. But in the last month I had one of the most stimulating, exhausting times of my life, indeed also one of the most successful. I could not think of writing.”[28 November  1915 Einstein's mail to Sommerfeld]

>“Most gratifying is the agreement with perihelion motion and the general covariance; strangest, however, is the circumstance that Newton’s theory of the field is incorrect already in the 1st order eq. (appearance of the g11-g33). It is just the circumstance that the g11-g33’s do not appear in first-order approximations of the motion eqs. which determines the simplicity of Newton’s theory. Now Planck also is beginning to take the matter more seriously; he is still resisting a bit, though. But he is a splendid person.”[21 December 1915 Einstein's mail to Michele Besso]

>“Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into **lazy habits of thinking**.”

>“Nevertheless, due to the inneratomic movement of electrons, atoms would have to radiate not only electromagnetic but also gravitational energy, if only in tiny amounts. As this is hardly true in nature, it appears that **quantum theory would have to modify not only Maxwellian electrodynamics, but also the new theory of gravitation**.” [1916, few months after he formulated his general relativity, he already realized it must be quantized.]

>“Unthinking respect for authority is the greatest enemy of truth.”

>“At present I occupy myself exclusively with the problem of gravitation and now believe that I shall master all difficulties with the help of a friendly mathematician here (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Grossmann" target="_blank">Marcel Grossmann</a>). But one thing is certain, in all my life I have never labored nearly as hard, and I have become imbued with **great respect for mathematics, the subtler part of which I had in my simple-mindedness regarded as pure luxury until now**. Compared with this problem, the original relativity is child’s play.” [After nearly ten years of hard work, in a letter to  A. Sommerfeld]

>“Who would have thought around 1900 that in fifty years time we would know so much more and understand so much less.”

>“People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a **stubbornly persistent illusion.**”

>“I believe with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank">Schopenhauer</a>: ***We can do what we wish, but we can only wish what we must***. Practically, I am, nevertheless, compelled to act as if freedom of the will existed. If I wish to live in a civilized community, I must act as if man is a responsible being. I know that philosophically a murderer is not responsible for his crime; nevertheless, I must protect myself from unpleasant contacts. I may consider him guiltless, but I prefer not to take tea with him.”

>“It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. **I do not believe in a personal God** and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.”

>“I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modelled after our own — a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbour such thoughts through **fear or ridiculous egotisms**.”

>“**I claim credit for nothing**. Everything is determined, the beginning as well as the end, by forces over which we have no control. It is determined for the insect as well as for the star. Human beings, vegetables or cosmic dust, we all dance to a mysterious tune, intoned in the distance by an invisible player.”

>“I believe in Spinoza's God, Who reveals Himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God Who concerns Himself with the fate and the doings of mankind.”

>“My views are near those of Spinoza: admiration for the beauty of and belief in the logical simplicity of the order which we can grasp humbly and only imperfectly. I believe that we have to content ourselves with our imperfect knowledge and understanding and treat values and moral obligations as a purely human problem—the most important of all human problems.”

>“At this point an enigma presents itself which in all ages has agitated inquiring minds. How can it be that **mathematics**, being, after all, a product of human thought which is independent of experience, is **so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality?** Is human reason, then, without experience, merely by taking thought, able to fathom the properties of real things?”

>“One reason why mathematics enjoys special esteem, above all other sciences, is that its laws are absolutely certain and indisputable, while those of other sciences are to some extent debatable and in constant danger of being overthrown by newly discovered facts.”

>“A theory is the more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises, the more different kinds of things it relates, and the more extended its area of applicability. Therefore the deep impression that classical thermodynamics made upon me. **It is the only physical theory of universal content which I am convinced will never be overthrown**, within the framework of applicability of its basic concepts.”

>“The world needs new moral impulses which, I'm afraid, won't come from the churches, heavily compromised as they have been throughout the centuries. Perhaps those impulses must come from scientists in the tradition of Galileo, Kepler and Newton. In spite of failures and persecutions, these men devoted their lives to proving that the universe is a single entity, in which, I believe, a humanized God has no place. The genuine scientist is not moved by praise or blame, nor does he preach. He unveils the universe and people come eagerly, without being pushed, to behold a new revelation: the order, the harmony, the magnificence of creation! And as man becomes conscious of the stupendous laws that govern the universe in perfect harmony, **he begins to realize how small he is**. He sees the pettiness of human existence, with its ambitions and intrigues, its "I am better than thou" creed. This is the beginning of cosmic religion within him; fellowship and human service become his moral code. And without such moral foundations, we are hopelessly doomed.”

>“Although I have been prevented by outward circumstances from observing a strictly vegetarian diet, I have long been an adherent to the cause in principle. Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and **moral reasons**, it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence a lot of mankind.”[1930]

>“Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet. Our task must be to free ourselves by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature and its beauty.”

>“If a man aspires towards a righteous life, his first act of abstinence is from injury to animals.”

>“I have always eaten animal flesh with a somewhat guilty conscience.”[1953 letter to Max Kariel]

>“So I am living without fats, without meat, without fish, but am feeling quite well this way. It always seems to me that man was not born to be a carnivore.”[1954]

>“Generations to come, it may well be, will scarce believe that such a man as this one [Gandhi] ever in flesh and blood walked upon this Earth.”[^Gandhi]

>“Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind.”

>“Only a life lived for **others** is a life worthwhile.”

>“In my opinion the only salvation for civilization and the human race lies in the creation of a **world government**, with security of nations founded upon law. As long as sovereign states continue to have separate armaments and armament secrets, new world wars will be inevitable.”

>“Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the present, but an equation is something for eternity.”

>“Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.” [Einstein's response to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell#Second_World_War" target="_blank">firing Russell</a>]

>“Being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination.”

>“I do not intend to be quiet about it [racism].”

>“I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state.”

>“This is the seventh anniversary of the establishment of the State of Israel. The establishment of this State was internationally approved and recognised largely for the purpose of rescuing the remnant of the Jewish people from unspeakable horrors of persecution and oppression.
>
>Thus, the establishment of Israel is an event which actively engages the conscience of this generation. It is, therefore, a bitter paradox to find that a State which was destined to be a shelter for a martyred people is itself threatened by grave dangers to its own security. The universal conscience cannot be indifferent to such peril.
>
>It is anomalous that world opinion should only criticize Israel’s response to hostility and should not actively seek to bring an end to the Arab hostility which is the root cause of the tension.” [Einstein died shortly before giving this speech.]

>“I have trouble with Dirac. This balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.”

>“It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.” [Source not found]

>“I have learned something else from the theory of gravitation: no collection of empirical facts however comprehensive can ever lead to the formulation of such complicated equations [...] Equations of such complexity as are the equations of the gravitational field can be found only through the discovery of a logically simple mathematical condition that determines the equations completely or [at least] almost completely. Once one has those sufficiently strong formal conditions, one requires only little knowledge of facts for thesetting up of a theory; in the case of the equations of gravitation it is the four- dimensionality and the symmetric tensor as expression for the structure of space which together with the invariance concerning the continuous transformation group, determine the equations almost completely.”

>“The **supreme task** of the physicist is to arrive at those universal elementary laws from which the cosmos can be built up by pure deduction. There is no logical path to these laws; only intuition, resting on sympathetic understanding of experience, can reach them. In this methodological uncertainty, one might suppose that there were any number of possible systems of theoretical physics all equally well justified; and this opinion is no doubt correct, theoretically. But the development of physics has shown that at any given moment, out of all conceivable constructions, a **single one has always proved itself decidedly superior** to all the rest.”

>“As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.”

>“But the truth of a theory will never be proved. Because one can never know if, in the future, some experience will become known that would contradict its conclusion.”[1919]

>“How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people — first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. **A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead**, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving...”

>“A man who is convinced of the truth of his religion is **indeed never tolerant**. At the least, he is to feel pity for the adherent of another religion but usually it does not stop there. The faithful adherent of a religion will try first of all to convince those that believe in another religion and usually he goes on to hatred if he is not successful. However, hatred then leads to persecution when the might of the majority is behind it.”

>“I would have transferred even more money to you, but I have no more myself to be able to manage at all without help..... **I myself lead the simplest, almost meager existence imaginable**. In this way we can lay quite a lot aside for the children..... I have duly noted your threat “to seek the assistance of other persons”; I know very well anyway from your previous behavior what I have to expect from you. Nothing will surprise me, no matter what you do. You have taken my children away from me and are ensuring that their attitude toward their father is vitiated. You will also take away from me other people who are close to me and will try to spoil in every way whatever has remained of my joy of living. This is the proper punishment for my weakness in allowing myself to shackle my life to yours. But I repeat: You will not surprise me, no matter what you do.” [15 September 1914 to Mileva Marić]

>“Best regards to Albert and Tete. As long as Albert does not answer my letter I must assume that it has not been given to him. Otherwise I would write to him again. Greetings from me to the children do not seem to be relayed, otherwise they would have sent their regards to me at least once in this long period. Thus it is actually useless to renew the same every time.” [12 December 1914 to Mileva Marić]

>“I received your letter just now, the unkind tone of which dismays me very much. I see from your long delay and from the unfriendliness of your letter that my visit would bring you little joy. Therefore I consider it not right that I sit in the train 2 • 20 hours without the result of making someone happy. I’ll come to visit you again only when you ask me to do so yourself. At Easter I’m going to be in Switzerland anyway, because I must attend a meeting in Berne. I’ll send you the Christmas present in cash as you wish. **But I do think that a luxury gift costing Fr. 70 does not match our modest circumstances**.” [30 November 1915 to his son]

>“There has been a certain ill-feeling between us, the cause of which I do not want to analyze. I have struggled against the feeling of bitterness attached to it, and this with complete success.
>
>I think of you again with unmixed geniality and ask you to try to do the same with me. Objectively it is a **shame when two real fellows who have extricated themselves somewhat from this shabby world do not afford each other mutual pleasure**.” [20 December 1915 to Hilbert] [^Hilbert]

>“Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited.”

>“I have expressed an opinion on public issues whenever they appeared to me so bad and unfortunate that silence would have made me feel guilty of complicity.”

>“Newton's age has long since passed through the sieve of oblivion, the doubtful striving and suffering of his generation has vanished from our ken; the works of some few great thinkers and artists have remained, to delight and ennoble those who come after us. Newton's discoveries have passed into the stock of accepted knowledge.”

>“In order to put his system into mathematical form at all, Newton had to devise the concept of differential quotients and propound the laws of motion in the form of total differential equations—perhaps **the greatest advance in thought that a single individual** was ever privileged to make.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank">Albert Einstein</a>

>“Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called duration: relative, apparent and common time, is some sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of duration by the means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true time ...”

>“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.”

>“To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. 'Tis much better to do a little with certainty, & leave the rest for others that come after you, than to explain all things by conjecture without making sure of any thing.”

>“I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.”

>“I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity from phenomena, and I frame no hypotheses; for whatever is not deduced from the phenomena is to be called a hypothesis, and hypotheses, whether metaphysical or physical, whether of occult qualities or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy.”

>“Plato is my friend — Aristotle is my friend — but my greatest friend is truth.”

>“I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of the people.”

>“I have studied these things — you have not.”[^NewtonAtheism]

>“Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. ***What one fool can do, another can.***”

>“I cannot understand why we idle discussing **religion**. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a **jumble of false assertions**, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why **primitive people**, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling.
>
>But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the **postulate** of an **Almighty God** helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit.
>
>**Religion** is a kind of **opium** that allows a **nation to lull itself into wishful dreams** and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of **all mortal sins**.”[^Dirac]

>“It seems clear that the present quantum mechanics is not in its final form. Some further changes will be needed, just about as drastic as the changes made in passing from Bohr's orbit theory to quantum mechanics. Some day a new quantum mechanics, a relativistic one, will be discovered, in which we will not have these infinities occurring at all. It might very well be that the new quantum mechanics will have determinism in the way that Einstein wanted.”

>“There was difficulty reconciling the Newtonian theory of gravitation with its instantaneous propagation of forces with the requirements of special relativity; and Einstein working on this difficulty was led to a generalization of his relativity—which was probably the greatest scientific discovery that was ever made.”

>“The underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known, and the difficulty is only that the exact application of these laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble. It therefore becomes desirable that approximate practical methods of applying quantum mechanics should be developed, which can lead to an explanation of the main features of complex atomic systems without too much computation.”

>“Einstein was always rather hostile to guantum mechanics. How can one understand this? I think it is very easy to understand, because Einstein had been proceeding on different lines, lines of pure geometry. He had been developing geometrical theories and had achieved enormous success. It is only natural that he should think that further problems of physics should be solved by further development of geometrical ideas. How, to have a x b not equal to b x a is something that does not fit in very well with geometrical ideas; hence his hostility to it.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac" target="_blank">P.A.M Dirac</a>

>“Religion is an insult to **human dignity**. Without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.But for good people to do evil things, that takes **religion**.”

>“Most of us do elementary-particle physics neither because of the intrinsic interestingness of the phenomena that we study, nor because of the practical importance of what we learn, but because we are pursuing a reductionist vision. All of the properties of ordinary matter are what they are because of the principles of atomic and nuclear physics, which are what they are because of the rules of the Standard Model of elementary particles, which are what they are because…well, we don’t know, this is the reductionist frontier, which we are currently exploring.”

>“The wave fields $\phi$, $\varphi$, etc, are not probability amplitudes at all, but operators which create or destroy particles in the various normal modes. It would be a good thing if the misleading expression ‘second quantization’ were permanently retired.”

>“Our immersion in the present state of physics makes it hard for us to understand the difficulties of physicists even a few years ago, or to profit from their experience. At the same time, a knowledge of our history is a mixed blessing — it can stand in the way of the logical reconstruction of physical theory that seems to be continually necessary.”

>“During the SSC debate, Anderson and other condensed-matter physicists repeatedly made the point that the knowledge gained in elementary-particle physics would be unlikely to help them to understand emergent phenomena like superconductivity. This is certainly true, but I think beside the point, because that is not why we are studying elementary particles; our aim is to push back the reductive frontier, to get closer to whatever simple and general theory accounts for everything in nature. ... experience shows that the ideas developed in one field can prove very useful in the other. Sometimes these ideas become transformed in translation, so that they even pick up a renewed value to the field in which they were first conceived. The example that concerns me is an idea that elementary-particle physicists learnt from condensed-matter theory – specifically from the BCS theory. It is the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking.” 

>“I think the world needs to wake up from its long nightmare of religious belief; and anything that we scientists can do to ***weaken the hold of religion*** should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.

>“I have a friend — or had a friend, now dead — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam" target="_blank">Abdus Salam</a>, a very devout Muslim, who was trying to bring science into the universities in the Gulf states and he told me that he had a terrible time because, although they were very receptive to technology, they felt that science would be a corrosive to religious belief, and they were worried about it... and damn it, I think they were right. ***It is corrosive of religious belief, and it's a good thing too***.”

>“The steady state theory is philosophically the most attractive theory because it least resembles the account given in Genesis.”

>“I know atheists that have the highest moral standards, for instance myself!”

>“The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more **it also seems pointless**.”

>“The effort to understand the universe is one of the very few things which lifts human life a little above the level of farce and gives it some of the grace of tragedy.”

>“Despite the weakness of the early experimental evidence for general relativity, Einstein’s theory became the standard textbook theory of gravitation in the 1920s and retained that position from then on, even while the various eclipse expeditions of the 1920s and 1930s were reporting at best equivocal evidence for the theory. … Perhaps all of us were just gullible and lucky, but I do not think that is the real explanation. I believe that the general acceptance of general relativity was due in large part to the attractions of the theory itself—in short, to its **beauty**.”

>“The other mistake that is widely attributed to Einstein is that he was on the wrong side in his famous debate with Niels Bohr over quantum mechanics, starting at the Solvay Congress of 1927 and continuing into the 1930s. In brief, Bohr had presided over the formulation of a “Copenhagen interpretation” of quantum mechanics, in which it is only possible to calculate the probabilities of the various possible outcomes of experiments. Einstein rejected the notion that the laws of physics could deal with probabilities, famously decreeing that God does not play dice with the cosmos. But history gave its verdict against Einstein—quantum mechanics went on from success to success, leaving Einstein on the sidelines.<br>
All this familiar story is true, but it leaves out an irony. Bohr’s version of quantum mechanics was deeply flawed, but not for the reason Einstein thought. The Copenhagen interpretation describes what happens when an observer makes a measurement, but the observer and the act of measurement are themselves treated classically. This is surely wrong: Physicists and their apparatus must be governed by the same quantum mechanical rules that govern everything else in the universe.”

>“My princeton professors were casual about grading. Arthur wightman was a starring figure on the mathematical side of quantum field theory and, in my first year at princeton, gave the course on advanced quantum mechanics. For some reason, he had recently become interested in the statistical properties of polarized light, and lectured at length about stokes parameters, the numerical quantities used to describe the probabilities of various polarizations. This had nothing to do with the exciting recent advances in quantum electrodynamics. He made up for this with his final exam. It was a take-home problem, to reproduce julian schwinger's classic calculation in quantum electrodynamics of the strength of the electron's magnetic field. After we had handed in our calculations, wightman told us that he was going to go home and burn them without reading them. The point was to give us the experience of doing this sort of calculation, not to judge us. I don't recall if I was happy about this at the time, but this exercise turned out to be the most valuable part of all my course work as a graduate student.”

>“I buckled down and finally began to learn modern quantum electrodynamics. I saw the necessity of digging into the literature on my own, and even then I didn't entirely trust the authorities I was reading. Feynman seemed to me too hand-waving, airily taking flight above difficulties. Concededly, that sort of thing can be a marvelous aid to progress. But it can be taken too far. On the other hand, schwinger and tomonaga seemed to me unnecessarily formalistic and plodding. I finally found enlightenment in the papers published by freeman dyson in 1949.

And um, I think it's... it's been disappointing because the idea of string theory as a theory of fundamental forces has been around now for quite a while, uh, a number of decades, and it has not led to the kind of specific prediction. Well, it makes some qualitative predictions, like it explains why gravity has to exist, but it has not led to the kind of specific numerical predictions, which will say, well, okay, now you can take it to the bank.

What is proved - whether truly or not, whether optimally or not, in an acceptable logical sequence or not - is that the existing theory is consistent with the spin-statistics relation. What is not demonstrated is a reason for the spin-statistics relation.

>To belabor the point, it is difficult to imagine a fundamental mechanism for the Pauli Exclusion Principle - upon which all depends - which predicates it (looking ahead to the work of Hall and Wightman) upon the analyticity properties of vacuum expectation values of products of quantized field operators. Did God - for lack of a better word - build a series of failed worlds which sputtered and died, or exploded and disintegrated, before discovering the stabilizing effect of anticommutation relations for half-integral spin fields? Was this before or after imposing the requirements of Lorentz invariance? Are we the lucky winners of a Monte Carlo simulation in which every choice was tried and one survived?

Both Newton and Einstein put forward a theory of mechanics and a theory of gravity but Einstein was able to base General Relativity on the mathematical theory of curved spaces that had been constructed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann" target="_blank">Riemann</a> while Newton had to develop his own mathematical machinery.

A major row ensued over who had been first, with scientists vigorously defending both contenders. It is remarkable, however, that most of the articles appearing in defense of Newton were originally **written by his own hand** – and only published in the name of friends! As the row grew, Leibniz made the mistake of appealing to the Royal Society to resolve the dispute. Newton, as president, appointed an “impartial” committee to investigate, coincidentally consisting entirely of Newton’s friends! But that was not all: Newton then wrote the committee’s report himself and had the Royal Society publish it, officially accusing Leibniz of plagiarism. Still unsatisfied, he then wrote an anonymous review of the report in the Royal Society’s own periodical. Following the death of Leibniz, Newton is reported to have declared that he had taken great satisfaction in "breaking Leibniz’s heart."”

The launching of the space fleet is an inevitability. In fact neither of the people can yet know of the launching of the space fleet. They can know only later, when telescopic observations from Earth reveal that the fleet is indeed on its way. Then they can hark back to that chance encounter, and come to the conclusion that at that time, according to one of them, the decision lay in the uncertain future, while to the other, it lay in the certain past.

It may be that later, e.g. in connection with the living processes, one will find something entirely new, but to dream of a way back, back to the classical style of Newton-Maxwell (and these are just dreams these gentlemen are giving themselves up to) seems to me hopeless, digressive, bad taste.

Admittedly, this is a far cry from the contents of religion. I don't believe Einstein is tied to any religious tradition, and I rather think the idea of a personal God is entirely foreign to him. But as far as he is concerned there is no split between science and religion: the central order is part of the subjective as well as the objective realm, and this strikes me as being a far better starting point.”

>“To me, it's implausible that humans stumbled by accident on such an incredible structure that sheds so much light on established physical theories, and also on so many different branches of mathematics, and that it's all an accident and it has nothing to do with real world.”

>“I don't think that any physicist would have been clever enough to have invented string theory on purpose... Luckily, it was invented by accident.”

>“String theory is extremely attractive because gravity is forced upon us. All known consistent string theories include gravity, so while gravity is impossible in quantum field theory as we have known it, it is obligatory in string theory.”

>“It's been said that string theory is part of the physics of the twenty-first century that fell by chance into the twentieth century. That's a remark that was made by a leading physicist about fifteen years ago. ...String theory was invented essentially by accident in a long series of events, starting with the Veneziano model... No one invented it on purpose, it was invented in a lucky accident. ...By rights, string theory shouldn't have been invented until our knowledge of some of the areas that are prerequisite... had developed to the point that it was possible for us to have the right concept of what it is all about.”

>“Generally speaking, all the really great ideas of physics are really spin-offs of string theory... Some of them were discovered first, but I consider that a mere accident of the development on planet earth. On planet earth, they were discovered in this order [general relativity, quantum field theory, superstrings, and supersymmetry]... But I don't believe, if there are many civilizations in the universe, that those four ideas were discovered in that order in each civilization.”

>“If one wants to summarize our knowledge of physics in the briefest possible terms, there are three really fundamental observations: (i) Space-time is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold $M$, endowed with a metric tensor and governed by geometrical laws. (ii) Over $M$ is a vector bundle $X$ with a nonabelian gauge group $G$. (iii) Fermions are sections of $(\hat{S}\_{+}\otimes V\_R) \oplus(\hat{S}\_{-}\otimes V\_{\tilde{R}})$. $R$ and $\tilde{R}$ are not isomorphic; their failure to be isomorphic explains why the light fermions are light and presumably has its origins in a representation difference $\Delta$ in some underlying theory. All of this must be supplemented with the understanding that the geometrical laws obeyed by the metric tensor, the gauge fields, and the fermions are to be interpreted in quantum mechanical terms.”

>“Interestingly, both quantum entanglement and wormholes date back to two articles written by Albert Einstein and his collaborators in 1935. On the surface, the papers seem to deal with very different phenomena, and Einstein probably never suspected that there could be a connection between them. In fact, entanglement was a property of quantum mechanics that greatly bothered the German-born physicist, who called it “spooky action at a distance.” How ironic that it now may offer a bridge to extend his relativity theory to the quantum realm.”

>“Elegance requires that the number of defining equations be small. Five is better than ten, and one is better than five. On this score, one might facetiously say that String Theory is the ultimate epitome of elegance. With all the years that String Theory has been studied, no one has found even a single defining equation! The number at present count is zero. We know neither what the fundamental equations of the theory are nor even if it has any.”

>“[Smolin] is mistaking an aspect of the mathematical language being used for one of the physics being described. New physical theories are often discovered using a mathematical language that is not the most suitable for them… In string theory, it has always been clear that the physics is background-independent even if the language being used is not, and the search for a more suitable language continues. Indeed, as Smolin belatedly notes, [AdS/CFT] provides a solution to this problem, one that is unexpected and powerful.”

>“Steve [Weinberg], you are certainly the most eloquent champion of the reductionist program in physics that progress in physics is, um, you know, understanding things at shorter and shorter distances. And there was a moment in the 80s. Where it looked as if String Theory could be The Final Step in that reductionist program. That moment evaporated very quickly within a year or 2, I would say. And instead of being everything it is more.... it's a Wellspring of ideas. Um, it gives us ideas of how different quantum systems fit together. And it could find a place in nature which isn't exactly the um, you know the the final Capstone on the reductionist program. 
>
>**An example I would like to use to put this in perspective is Yang Mills theory. Yang and Mills invented Yang Mills theory to explain the relationship between the proton and the neutron. That was wrong. I've never heard anybody say Yang Mills Theory is wrong, but what Yang and Mills wanted to do with it in that 1954 paper was undeniably wrong. It doesn't explain. Now it doesn't explain that. It explains something else, you got your Nobel Prize and other people got them too for understanding what it was that it did explain. So we wouldn't say Yang Mills theory... certainly Yang and Mills didn't understand how Yang Mills theory fits into nature. And I think string theory is like that it has an inevitability to it. Like, uh Yang Mills Theory did.**
>
>Maybe it's not ruled out that it is the final end point of the reductionist program, but it might find a place in nature and that's how it feels to me, that it has... and that's already happened to some extent. We've used it to explain things about superconductors and heavy ion collisions and so on. Um, It might find a place in nature. That isn't what exactly what its originators imagined and it almost never happens in physics that an idea comes out fully formed into its right place. They get battered around and that I think is already happened to a great extent with string theory. And then it's not right in my mind to hold it up to the standard of it should be a theory of everything or it's not interesting.”[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFJ46G8BflQ&t=3184s" target="_blank">YouTube</a>]

>“Black holes hold an impressive number of world records, both observational and theoretical. In astrophysics, they are believed to be the densest objects and to power the most luminous sources. In the theoretical realm, black holes push the extremes of gravitation and quantum mechanics and in several cases actually set fundamental limits—on density, entropy, and a growing list of other attributes—for quantum systems. Adam Brown and colleagues, now argue that we should add a new world record to the list: computational complexity.” [Black holes also saturate the bound on chaos.]

This seems unfair, like physicists have some kind of secret weapon that mathematicians are unable to wield. And we do. In fact, we have two. The first is the path integral. The second, a wilful disregard for rigour.” <a href="http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/susy/susyqm.pdf" target="_blank">susyqm</a>

>“We are now at the end of this introductory course on string theory. We began by trying to make sense of the quantum theory of a relativistic string moving in flat space. It is, admittedly, an odd place to start. But from then on we had no choices to make. The relativistic string leads us ineluctably to conformal field theory, to higher dimensions of spacetime, to Einstein’s theory of gravity at low-energies, to good UV behaviour at high-energies and to Yang-Mills theories living on branes. There are few stories in theoretical physics where such meagre input gives rise to such a rich structure.
>
>This journey continues. There is one further ingredient that it is necessary to add: supersymmetry. Even this is in some sense not a choice, but is necessary to remove the troublesome tachyon that plagued these lectures. From there we may again blindly follow where the string leads, through anomalies (and the lack thereof) in ten dimensions, to dualities and M-theory in eleven dimensions, to mirror symmetry and moduli stabilization and black hole entropy counting and holography and the miraculous AdS/CFT correspondence.” <a href="https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/string/string.pdf" target="_blank">string</a>

>“So, what is quantum mechanics? Even though it was discovered by physicists, it’s not a physical theory in the same sense as electromagnetism or general relativity. In the usual “hierarchy of sciences” – with biology at the top, then chemistry, then physics, then math – quantum mechanics sits at a level between math and physics that I don’t know a good name for. Basically, quantum mechanics is the operating system that other physical theories run on as application software (with the exception of general relativity, which hasn’t yet been successfully ported to this particular OS). There’s even a word for taking a physical theory and porting it to this OS: “to quantize.””

>“I must have been 8 or 9 when my father, a man of letters but well-read in every discipline and with a curious mind, told me this story: “A great scientist named Albert Einstein discovered that any object with a mass can't travel faster than the speed of light”. To my bewilderment I replied, boldly: “This can't be true, if I run almost at that speed and then accelerate a little, surely I will run faster than light, right?” My father was adamant: “No, it's impossible to do what you say, it's a known physics fact”. After a while I added: “That bloke, Einstein, must've checked this thing many times … how do you say, he did many experiments?” The answer I got was utterly unexpected: “Not even one I believe. He used maths!”

But if we wish to pursue this question courageously, we must of course ask the next question: where did God come from? If we decide that this is an unanswerable question, why not save a step and conclude that the origin of the Universe is an unanswerable question? Or, if we say that God always existed, why not save a step, and conclude that the Universe always existed? That there's no need for a creation, it was always here.

### Mathematicians

>“The physicists want to do path integrals, that is, they want to integrate some "Action Man functional" over the space of all paths or loops $\gamma:[0,1] \rightarrow Y$. This impossibly large integral is one of the major schisms between math and fizz. The physicists learn a number of computations in finite terms that approximate their path integrals, and when sufficiently skilled and imaginative, can use these to derive marvellous consequences; whereas the mathematicians give up on making sense of the space of paths, and not infrequently derive satisfaction or a misplaced sense of superiority from pointing out that the physicists' calculations can equally well be used (or abused!) to prove $0=1$. **Maybe it's time some of us also evolved some skill and imagination**. The motivic integration treated in the next section builds a miniature model of the physicists' path integral, by restricting first to germs of holomorphic paths $\gamma: U \rightarrow Y$, where $0 \in U \subset \mathbb{C}$ is a neighbourhood of 0 , then to formal power series $\gamma: \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{C} [\\![z]\\!]\rightarrow Y$.” [<a href="https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masda/McKay/Bour/Bour.pdf" target="_blank">Source</a>]

In a famous passage, Poincaré describes how he discovered Fuchsian functions in such a moment. About such states, Gauss is said to have remarked as follows: "Procreare jucundum (to conceive is a pleasure)"; he added, however, "sed parturire molestum (but to give birth is painful)." **Unlike sexual pleasure, this feeling may last for hours at a time, even for days. Once you have experienced it, you are eager to repeat it but unable to do so at will**, unless perhaps by dogged work which it seems to reward with its appearance. It is true that the pleasure experienced is not necessarily in proportion with the value of the discoveries with which it is associated.”

### Philosophers

>“And so it would seem that the **denial of the reality of time** is not so very paradoxical after all. It was called paradoxical because it seemed to contradict our experience so violently-to compel us to treat so much as illusion which appears *prima facie* to give knowledge of reality. But we now see that our experience of time-centring as it does about the specious present-would be no less illusory if there were a real time in which the realities we experience existed. The specious present of our observations - varying as it does from you to me-cannot correspond to the present of the events, observed. And consequently the past and future of our observations could not correspond to the past and future of the events observed. On either hypothesis - whether we take time as real or as unreal-everything is observed in a specious present, but nothing, not even the observations themselves, can ever be in a specious present. And in that case I do not see that we treat experience as much more illusory when we say that nothing is ever in a present at all, than when we say that everything passes through some entirely different present.
>
>Our conclusion, then, is that neither time as a whole, nor the [A series and B series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_series_and_B_series){:target="_blank"}, really exist. But this leaves it possible that the C series does really exist. The A series was rejected for its inconsistency. And its rejection involved the rejection of the B series. But we have found no such contradiction in the C series, and its invalidity does not follow from the invalidity of the A series.

Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the origin of suffering: it is this craving which leads to re-becoming, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there; that is, **craving for sensual pleasures**, craving for becoming, craving for disbecoming.<br>
Now this, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering: it is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non-reliance on it.<br>

The argument is really no better than that.”

>“Quite illogically, the victory of Locke’s philosophy in England and France was largely due to the prestige of Newton. Descartes’ authority as a philosopher was enhanced, in his own day, by his work in mathematics and natural philosophy.

But I cannot say that Buddhism is positively good, nor would I wish to have it spread all over the world and believed by everyone. This is because Buddhism only focuses on the question of what Man is, not on what the universe is like. **Buddhism does not really pursue the truth**; it **appeals to sentiment** and, ultimately, tries to persuade people to believe in doctrines which are based on subjective assumptions not objective evidence.” 

>“A much more desirable way of securing world peace would be by a voluntary agreement among nations to pool their armed forces and submit to an **agreed single supreme world government**.”

>“We have had in recent years a brilliant example of the **scientific temper** of mind in the theory of relativity and its reception by the world. Einstein, a German-Swiss-Jew pacifist, was appointed to a research professorship by the German Government in the early days of the War; his predictions were verified by an English expedition which observed the eclipse of 1919, very soon after the Armistice. His theory upsets the whole theoretical framework of traditional physics; it is almost as damaging to orthodox dynamics [Newtonian physics] as Darwin was to Genesis. Yet physicists everywhere have shown complete readiness to accept his theory as soon as it appeared that the evidence was in its favour. But none of them, least of all Einstein himself, would claim that he has said the last word. He has not built a monument of infallible dogma to stand for all time. There are difficulties he cannot solve; his doctrines will have to be modified in their turn as they have modified Newton's. This critical undogmatic receptiveness is the true attitude of science.”

>“Just about at the time of the Armistice his father had died, and Wittgenstein inherited the bulk of his fortune. **He came to the conclusion, however, that money is a nuisance to a philosopher**, so he gave every penny of it to his brother and sisters. Consequently he was unable to pay the fare from Vienna to the Hague, and was far too proud to accept it from me. ... He must have suffered during this time hunger and considerable privation, though it was very seldom that he could be induced to say anything about it, as he had the pride of Lucifer. At last his sister decided to build a house, and employed him as an architect. This gave him enough to eat for several years, at the end of which he returned to Cambridge as a don...”

>“Wittgenstein is very excitable: he has more passion about philosophy than I have; his avalanches make mine seem mere snowballs. He has the pure intellectual passion in the highest degree; it makes me love him. His disposition is that of an artist, intuitive and moody. He says every morning he begins his work with hope, and every evening he ends in despair — he has just the sort of rage when he can't understand things as I have.”

>“The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have **grown tired of serious thinking** and to have invented a doctrine which would make such an activity unnecessary. I do not for one moment believe that the doctrine which has these **lazy consequences** is true. I realize, however, that I have an overpoweringly strong bias against it, for, if it is true, philosophy is, at best, a slight help to lexicographers, and at worst, an idle tea-table amusement.”

>“There are two great men in history with whom he [Wittgenstein] somewhat resembles. One was Pascal, other was Tolstoy. Pascal was a mathematician of genius, but abandoned mathematics for piety. Tolstoy sacrificed his genius as a writer to a kind of bogus humility which made him prefer peasants to educated men and *Uncle Tom's Cabin* to all other works of fiction. Wittgenstein, who could play with metaphysical intricacies as cleverly as Pascal with Hexagons or Tolstoy with emperors, threw away this talent and debased himself before the peasants — in each case from an impulse of pride. I admired Wittgenstein's Tractatus but not his later work, which seemed to me to involve an abnegation of his own best talent very similar to those of Pascal and Tolstoy.... [M]ental torments which made him and Pascal and Tolstoy pardonable in spite of **their treachery to their own greatness**.”

>“I cannot forbear adding to these reasonings an observation, which may, perhaps, be found of some importance. In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surprized to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses some new relation or affirmation, it is necessary that it should be observed and explained; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others, which are entirely different from it. But as authors do not commonly use this precaution, I shall presume to recommend it to the readers; and am persuaded, that this small attention would subvert all the vulgar systems of morality, and let us see, that the distinction of vice and virtue is not founded merely on the relations of objects, nor is perceived by reason.”[^Hume]

>“For if God is consciousness, he is integrated in the totality.

Thus no point of view on the totality is conceivable; the totality has no ‘outside’ and the very question of the meaning of the ‘underside’ is stripped of meaning.

>“In speaking of the fear of religion, I don’t mean to refer to the entirely reasonable hostility toward certain established religions and religious institutions, in virtue of their objectionable moral doctrines, social policies, and political influence. Nor am I referring to the association of many religious beliefs with superstition and the acceptance of evident empirical falsehoods. I am talking about something much deeper—namely, the fear of religion itself. I speak from experience, being strongly subject to this fear myself: I want atheism to be true and am made uneasy by the fact that some of the most intelligent and well-informed people I know are religious believers. It isn’t just that I don’t believe in God and, naturally, hope that I’m right in my belief. It’s that I hope there is no God! I don’t want there to be a God; I don’t want the universe to be like that.”

>“I agree with Dawkins that the issue of design versus purely physical causation is a scientific question. He is correct to dismiss Stephen Jay Gould’s position that science and religion are “non-overlapping magisteria.” The conflict is real. But although I am as much of an outsider to religion as he is, I believe it is much more difficult to settle the question than he thinks. I also suspect there are other possibilities besides these two that have not even been thought of yet. The fear of religion leads too many scientifically minded atheists to cling to a defensive, world-flattening reductionism. Dawkins, like many of his contemporaries, is hobbled by the assumption that the ***only alternative to religion is to insist that the ultimate explanation of everything must lie in particle physics, string theory, or whatever purely extensional laws*** govern the elements of which the material world is composed. This reductionist dream is nourished by the extraordinary success of the physical sciences in our time, not least in their recent application to the understanding of life through molecular biology. It is natural to try to take any successful intellectual method as far as it will go. Yet the impulse to find an explanation of everything in physics has over the last fifty years gotten out of control. The concepts of physical science provide a very special, and partial, description of the world that experience reveals to us. It is the world with all subjective consciousness, sensory appearances, thought, value, purpose, and will left out. What remains is the mathematically describable order of things and events in space and time.”

And if it is true, as Nietzsche claims, that a philosopher, to deserve our respect, must preach by example, you can appreciate the importance of that reply, for it will precede the definitive act. These are facts the heart can feel; yet they call for careful study before they become clear to the intellect. If I ask myself how to judge that this question is more urgent than that, I reply that one judges by the actions it entails. I have never seen anyone die for the ontological argument.”

If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.—In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.”

It springs rather from my conviction that, if our civilization is to survive, we must break with the habit of deference to great men. Great men may make great mistakes; and as the book tries to show, some of the greatest leaders of the past supported the perennial attack on freedom and reason. Their influence, too rarely challenged, continues to mislead those on whose defence civilization depends, and to divide them. The responsibility of this tragic and possibly fatal division becomes ours **if we hesitate to be outspoken in our criticism of what admittedly is a part of our intellectual heritage. By reluctance to criticize some of it, we may help to destroy it all.**”

>“I believe that there is, from the ethical point of view, no symmetry between suffering and happiness, or between pain and pleasure. Both the greatest happiness principle of the Utilitarians and Kant's principle 'Promote other people's happiness ..' seem to me (at least in their formulations) wrong on this point which, however, is not completely decidable by rational argument. In my opinion human suffering makes a direct moral appeal, namely, the appeal for help, while there is no similar call to increase the happiness of a man who is doing well anyway. (A further criticism of the Utilitarian formula 'Maximize pleasure' is that it assumes, in principle, a continuous pleasure-pain scale which allows us to treat degrees of pain as negative degrees of pleasure. But, from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure, and especially not one man's pain by another man's pleasure. **Instead of the greatest happiness for the greatest number**, one should demand, more modestly, **the least amount of avoidable suffering for all**; and further, that unavoidable suffering—such as hunger in times of an unavoidable shortage of food—should be distributed as equally as possible.)”

>“Sexual love makes of the loved person an ***Object of appetite***; as soon as that appetite has been stilled, the person is cast aside as one casts away a lemon which has been sucked dry. Sexual love can, of course, be combined with human love and so carry with it the characteristics of the latter, but taken by itself and for itself, it is nothing more than appetite. Taken by itself it is a ***degradation of human nature***; for as soon as a person becomes an Object of appetite for another, all motives of moral relationship cease to function, because as an Object of appetite for another a person becomes a thing and can be treated and used as such by every one. This is the only case in which a human being is designed by nature as the Object of another's enjoyment. Sexual desire is at the root of it; and that is why ***we are ashamed of it***, and why all strict moralists, and those who had pretensions to be regarded as saints, sought to ***suppress and extirpate*** it. It is true that without it a man would be incomplete; he would rightly believe that he lacked the necessary organs, and this would make him imperfect as a human being; none the less men made pretence on this question and sought to ***suppress these inclinations because they degraded mankind***.” [1760s, Lectures on Ethics, p. 163]

>“If then a man wishes to satisfy his desire, and a woman hers, they stimulate each other’s desire ; their inclinations meet, but their object is not human nature but sex, and each of them dishonours the human nature of the other.

>“This, evidently was not a minor civilization, produced by inferior people. It ranks with the highest civilizations of history, and some, like Keyserling, would place it at the head and summit of all. The British conquest of India was the **invasion and destruction of a high civilization by a trading company** (the British East India Company) utterly without scruple or principle, careless of art and greedy of gain, over-running with fire and sword a country temporarily disordered and helpless, bribing and murdering, annexing and stealing, and beginning that career of illegal and 'legal' plunder which has now gone on ruthlessly for one hundred and seventy-three years.”[1930]

>“Ashoka, one of the great monarchs of history, whose dominions extended from Afghanistan to Madras... is the only military monarch on record who abandoned warfare after victory. He had invaded Kalinga (255 B.C.), a country along the east coast of Madras, perhaps with some intention of completing the conquest of the tip of the Indian peninsula. The expedition was successful, but he was disgusted by what be saw of the cruelties and horrors of war. He declared, in certain inscriptions that still exist, that he would no longer seek conquest by war, but by religion, and the rest of his life was devoted to the spreading of Buddhism throughout the world. He seems to have ruled his vast empire in peace and with great ability. **He was no mere religious fanatic. For eight and twenty years Asoka worked sanely for the real needs of men.** Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history, their majesties and graciousnesses and serenities and royal highnesses and the like, the name of Asoka shines, and shines, almost alone, a star. From the Volga to Japan his name is still honoured. China, Tibet, and even India, though it has left his doctrine, preserve the tradition of his greatness. More living men cherish his memory to-day than have ever heard the names of Constantine or Charlemagne.”

>“In the history of the world there have been thousands of kings and emperors who called themselves "their highnesses," "their majesties," and "their exalted majesties" and so on. They shone for a brief moment, and as quickly disappeared. But Ashoka shines and shines brightly like a bright star, even unto this day.”

This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for. We all know that at some point in the future the Universe will come to an end and at some other point, considerably in advance from that but still not immediately pressing, the sun will explode. We feel there's plenty of time to worry about that, but on the other hand that's a very dangerous thing to say.”

>“No reputable theologian, or rational believer for that matter, adheres strictly to Biblical morality. As everyone knows, believers pick and choose their morality from a smorgasbord of divine commands, both good and bad, in scripture. And doing that shows that you have a sense of right and wrong that doesn’t come from the Bible or God. Ergo, it comes from evolution and culture.”

>“When something in science is disproven it get tossed on the junkpile of bad ideas. When something in religion gets disproven it becomes a metaphor.”

>“Science and religion, then, are competitors in the business of finding out what is true about our universe. In this goal religion has failed miserably, for its tools for discerning “truth” are useless. These areas are incompatible in precisely the same way, and in the same sense, that rationality is incompatible with irrationality.”

>“Although this book deals with the conflict between religion and science, I see this as only one battle in a wider war—a war between rationality and superstition. Religion is but a single brand of superstition (others include beliefs in astrology, paranormal phenomena, homeopathy, and spiritual healing), but it is the most widespread and harmful form of superstition. And science is but one form of rationality (philosophy and mathematics are others), but it is a highly developed form, and the only one capable of describing and understanding reality.”

>“I could go on, but the point is clear: religions make explicit claims about reality—about what exists and happens in the universe. These claims involve the existence of gods, the number of such gods (polytheism or monotheism), their character and behavior (usually loving and beneficent, but, in the case of Hindu and ancient Greek gods, sometimes mischievous or malevolent), how they interact with the world, whether or not there are souls or life after death, and, above all, how the deities wish us to behave—their moral code.<br>
These are empirical claims, and although some may be hard to test, they must, like all claims about reality, be defended with a combination of evidence and reason. If we find no credible evidence, no good reasons to believe, then those claims should be disregarded, just as most of us ignore claims about ESP, astrology, and alien abduction. After all, beliefs important enough to affect you for eternity surely deserve the closest scrutiny.”

>“Why, exactly, are scientists supposed to accord “respect” to a bunch of ancient fables that are not only ludicrous on their face, but motivate so much opposition to science?”

>“Religion claims to help us understand things about the universe, but, unlike science has no way to test or verify its claims. Both science and religion compete to understand reality, but only science has the method to verify its findings, while religion merely buttresses emotional and epistemic commitments made in advance, commitments impervious to evidence.”

>“Theology is the post hoc rationalization of what you want to believe.”

>“I am SO tired of this trope. It may indeed be the case that we can’t justify a priori via philosophical lucubrations that we arrive at the truth about nature only by using the methods of science. My answer to that is increasingly becoming, “So bloody what?” The use of science is justified because it works, not because we can justify it philosophically. If we are interested in finding out what causes malaria, no amount of appeal to a deity, philosophical rumination, listening to music, reading novels, or waiting for a revelation will answer that question. We have to use scientific methods, which, of course, is how causes of disease are found.”

>“The justification for naturalism is that it works: we have never understood anything about the universe by assuming the supernatural, while assuming naturalism as a working hypothesis has moved our understanding ever forward.”

>“My claim is this: science and religion are incompatible because they have different methods for getting knowledge about reality, have different ways of assessing the reliability of that knowledge, and, in the end, arrive at conflicting conclusions about the universe. “Knowledge” acquired by religion is at odds not only with scientific knowledge, but also with knowledge professed by other religions. In the end, religion’s methods, unlike those of science, are useless for understanding reality.”

>“In the end theologians are jealous of science, for they are aware that it has greater authority than do their own ways of finding “truth”: dogma, authority, and revelation. Science does find truth, faith does not.”

This point being once reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his **sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races**. If, indeed, such men are separated from him by great differences in appearance or habits, experience unfortunately shews us how long it is before we look at them as our fellow-creatures. **Sympathy beyond the confines of man, that is humanity to the lower animals, seems to be one of the latest moral acquisitions. It is apparently unfelt by savages, except towards their pets.** How little the old Romans knew of it is shewn by their abhorrent gladiatorial exhibitions. The very idea of humanity, as far as I could observe, was new to most of the Gauchos of the Pampas. This virtue, one of the noblest with which man is endowed, seems to arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming more tender and more widely diffused, until they are extended to all sentient beings. As soon as this virtue is honoured and practised by some few men, it spreads through instruction and example to the young, and eventually through public opinion.”

Men like Sir Isaac Newton were considered, and considered themselves, to be “natural philosophers”: men of scientific bent to be sure, but men of a wider and deeper learning as well. Arguments about greater cosmic purposes were all of a piece with calculations and experiments, and the tyranny of specialization had not imposed itself on us. As a result, by the way, many scientists held completely “unscientific” views. Newton himself was a secret alchemist who believed that the pope was anti-Christ and that the true dimensions of the Temple of Solomon might yield crucial findings. Joseph Priestley, the Unitarian discoverer of oxygen, was a devotee of the phlogiston theory. Alfred Russel Wallace liked nothing better than a good spiritualist séance. It is not really until the figure of Albert Einstein (and perhaps Bertrand Russell also) that we start to find that very powerful synthesis between scientific method and a more general “humanism”; a synthesis basing itself upon reason and daring to make the connection between physical and natural evidence and the conclusion that an ethical life, as well as a rational one, is best believed on the assumption that there is no supernatural dimension.”

>“I am greatly worried about the Somnath affair. As I feared, it is assuming a certain political importance. Indeed references have been made to it internationally also. In criticism of our policy in regard to it, we are asked **how a secular Government such as ours can associate itself with such a ceremony which is, in addition, revivalist in character**. Questions are being put to me in Parliament and I am replying to them saying that Government has nothing to do with it and those persons who are connected in any way are functioning entirely in their personal capacity.” [Letter to the first president of India Rajendra Prasad.]

>“I mentioned to the President sometime ago that I did not fancy his visiting the Somnath temple on this occasion. He said he had promised to do so and it was difficult for him to get out of his promise. There is nothing more to be done about it. **But I have made it clear both to the President and to Mr. Munshi that I do not at all like these activities**.”

>“But apart from this, I must be quite frank with you [Jam Saheb] about this ceremony. Indeed I have written to you about it in another connection already. I am troubled by this revivalism and by the fact that our President and some Ministers and you as Rajpramukh are associated with it. I think that this is not in line with the nature of our State and it will have bad consequences both nationally and internationally. As individuals, of course, it is open to anyone to do what he chooses in such matters. But many of us happen to be more than private individuals and we cannot dissociate ourselves from our public capacities.”

>“Reports from many sources have reached me that the communal atmosphere is again becoming tense, and that particularly the people who belong to the RSS…are becoming vocal and demonstrative again…. Many of the RSS men who had been arrested previously, detained in prison for sometime and then subsequently released, are again taking part in these activities in spite of assurances they might have given.”

>“We believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. **The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually**. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain **Purna Swaraj or complete independence**.”

Such a world federation would ensure the freedom of its constituent nations, the prevention of aggression and exploitation of one nation over another, the protection of national minorities, the advancement of all backward areas and peoples, and the pooling of the world's resources for the common good of all. On the establishment of such a world federation, **disarmament would be practicable in all countries, national armies, navies and air forces would no longer be necessary, and a world federal defence force would keep the peace and prevent aggression**. ...The Committee regretfully realizes, however, despite the tragic and overwhelming lessons of the war and the perils that overhang the world, the Governments of few countries are yet prepared to take this **inevitable step towards world federation**.”

>“We must constantly remind ourselves that whatever our religion or creed, we are all one people. I regret that many recent disturbances have given us a bad name.

If you, men of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force, serve your countrymen without distinction of class and religion, you will bring honour to yourselves and to your country.”

>“Instead of understanding and following the teachings of Jesus, the Christians argued and quarreled about the nature of Jesus’s divinity and about the Trinity. They called each other heretics and persecuted each other and cut each other’s heads off. There was a great and violent controversy at one time among different Christian sects over a certain diphthong. One party said that the word Homo-ousion should be used in a prayer; the other wanted Homoi-ousion-this difference had reference to the divinity of Jesus. Over this diphthong fierce war was raged and large numbers of people were slaughtered.”

>“The general Muslim outlook was thus one of Muslim nationalism or Muslim internationalism, and not of true nationalism. ... On the other hand, the Hindu idea of nationalism was definitely one of Hindu nationalism. **It was not easy in this case** (as it was in the case of the Muslims) **to draw a sharp line between this Hindu nationalism and true nationalism**. The two overlapped, as India is the only home of the Hindus and they form a majority there.”

>“Tibet is a very ticklish issue... We have to proceed rather cautiously in regard to it and we do not want it stated that we have been addressing the Chinese Government on this subject. They are sensitive and this itself might create an undesirable reaction in them... For some time past, I have been asked questions about Tibet at press conferences. I have answered them rather vaguely and tried to avoid any direct commitment... We do not intend to make any such clear declaration because whatever we say may be embarrassing either from a Chinese or a Tibetan point of view. Anything we say to the Chinese loses its effect to some extent if any public reference is made to it.”

>“I have become a queer mixture of the East and the West ... Out of place everywhere, at home nowhere. Perhaps my thoughts and approach to life are more akin to what is called Western than Eastern, but India clings to me, as she does to all her children, in innumerable ways ...

>“I will choose only the least harmful way for the country. And that is the greatest benefit I am conferring on the country by embracing Buddhism; for Buddhism is a part and parcel of Bhâratîya culture. **I have taken care that my conversion will not harm the tradition of the culture and history of this land**.”

>“The history of India is a history of mortal conflict between Buddhism and Brahmanism.”

>“As a matter of fact the Caste system came into being long after the different races of India had co-mingled in blood and culture. To hold that distinctions of Caste are really distinctions of race and to treat different Castes as though they were so many different races is a gross perversion of facts. What racial affinity is there between the Brahmin of the Punjab and the Brahmin of Madras? What racial affinity is there between the untouchables of Bengal and the the untouchables of Madras? What racial difference is there between the Brahmin of Punjab and the Chamar of Punjab? ... The Brahmin of Punjab is racially of the same stock as the Chamar of Punjab, and the Brahmin of Madras is the same race as the Pariah of Madras. Caste system does not demarcate racial division. Caste system is a social division of **people of the same race**.”

>“There can be no doubt that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_Buddhism_in_the_Indian_subcontinent" target="_blank">fall of Buddhism in India</a> was due to the invasions of the Musalmans. Islam came out as the enemy of the 'But'. The word 'But' as everybody knows, is the Arabic word and means an idol. Thus the origin of the word indicates that in the Moslem mind idol worship had come to be identified with the Religion of the Buddha. To the Muslims, they were one and the same thing. The mission to break the idols thus became the mission to destroy Buddhism. Islam destroyed Buddhism not only in India but wherever it went. Before Islam came into being Buddhism was the religion of Bactria, Parthia, Afghanistan, Gandhar, and Chinese Turkestan, as it was of the whole of Asia. In all these countries Islam destroyed Buddhism.”

>“Even a superficial observer cannot fail to notice that a spirit of aggression underlies the Hindu attitude towards the Muslim and the Muslim attitude towards the Hindu. The Hindu's spirit of aggression is a new phase which he has just begun to cultivate. The Muslim's spirit of aggression is his native endowment, and is ancient as compared with that of the Hindu. It is not that the Hindu, if given time, will not pick up and overtake the Muslim. But as matters stand to-day, the Muslim in this exhibition of the spirit of aggression leaves the Hindu far behind.”

>“Caste has however done one thing. It has completely disorganized and demoralized the Hindus.”

>“It is beyond doubt that serfdom continued in Europe although Christianity was an established institution for several hundred years. It is an incontrovertible fact that Christianity was not enough to end the slavery of the Negroes in the United States. **A civil war was necessary** to give the Negro the freedom which was denied to him by the Christians. The dependence of those in charge of Christian endeavour upon planting of an idea and leaving it to work a miracle is therefore one of the reasons why the untouchable has remained an untouchable notwithstanding his Christian faith.”

>“Islam is a close corporation and the distinction that it makes between Muslims and non-Muslims is a very real, very positive and very alienating distinction. The brotherhood of Islam is not the universal brotherhood of man. It is brotherhood of Muslims for Muslims only. There is a fraternity, but its benefit is confined to those within that corporation. For those who are outside the corporation, there is nothing but contempt and enmity. The second defect of Islam is that it is a system of social self-government and is incompatible with local self-government, because the allegiance of a Muslim does not rest on his domicile in the country which is his but on the faith to which he belongs. To the Muslim ibi bene ibi patria is unthinkable. Wherever there is the rule of Islam, there is his own country. In other words, Islam can never allow a true Muslim to adopt India as his motherland and regard a Hindu as his kith and kin. That is probably the reason why Maulana Mahomed Ali, a great Indian but a true Muslim, preferred to be buried in Jerusalem rather than in India.”

>“You must not only discard the Shastras, you must deny their authority, as did Buddha and Nanak. You must have courage to tell the Hindus that what is wrong with them is their religion—the religion which has produced in them this notion of the sacredness of Caste. Will you show that courage?”

>“It could hardly have been anticipated, for example, that a long-time follower of Mao Zedong, at five feet in height barely visible beside him, would use the power of the Chinese Communist Party to give his country a market economy: "It doesn't matter if the cat is white or black," Deng Xiaoping liked to say, "so long as it catches mice." Deng's views on cats—by which he meant ideologies—got him into trouble with Mao during the Cultural Revolution, and at the time of Nixon's 1972 visit to Beijing, Deng was in exile with his family growing vegetables, chopping wood, working in a tractor repair plant, and nursing his son, whom Red Guards had thrown from the roof of a building, permanently paralyzing him. Mao called Deng back to Beijing the following year, acknowledging that he had "done good deeds seventy percent of the time and bad deeds thirty percent"—only to purge him again in 1976. Always resilient, Deng fled to southern China, hid out, and patiently awaited yet another rehabilitation. It came shortly after Mao's death in September of that year, and by the end of  1978 Deng had outmaneuvered all of his rivals to become China's "paramount" leader. He had already by then turned the tables on his predecessor by claiming that Mao had been right seventy percent of the time and wrong thirty percent: this now became party doctrine. Among the "right" things Mao had done were reviving China as a great power, maintaining the Communist Party's political monopoly, and opening relations with the United States as a way of countering the Soviet Union. Among the "wrong" things was Mao's embrace of a disastrously administered command economy. With this pronouncement on percentages, Deng won himself room to pursue a very different path.”

>“It was no longer possible to say that only the Western world could become rich through capitalism, so a new narrative took hold: although a few developing countries might be able to enter global markets from the periphery, it is only because they are very small, almost insignificant. Strangely enough, today you sometimes hear the opposite: that developing countries might make it, but only if they are very large. This is due to the transformation of two giants, China and India, which for decades were held back by, in one case, a communist despot, and in the other a democratic but strictly protectionist command economy. Therefore, people said that Chinese and Indians will be successful all over the world – except in China and India. But then, in 1976, China’s dictator Mao Zedong, as the US economist Steven Radelet put it, ‘single-handedly and dramatically changed the direction of global poverty with one single act: he died’. His successor, Deng Xiaoping, began to accept the private enterprise that peasants and villagers secretly engaged in and extended it to the entire economy. All the restrained creativity and ambition was finally let loose and China grew at record speed. Ironically, intellectuals around the world – modern-day Max Webers – soon explained that this is itself not that strange, as Confucianism made it easy to modernize the economy.”

>“Deng is remembered primarily for the economic reforms he initiated while paramount leader of the People's Republic of China, which pivoted China towards a market economy, led to high economic growth, increased standards of living of hundreds of millions, expanded personal and cultural freedoms, and substantially integrated the country into the world economy. More people were lifted out of poverty during his leadership than during any other time in human history, attributed largely to his reforms. For this reason, some have suggested that Deng should have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Deng is also credited with reducing the cult of Mao Zedong and with bringing an end to the chaotic era of the Cultural Revolution. Furthermore, his strong-handed tactics have been credited with keeping the People's Republic of China unified, in contrast to the other major Communist power of the time, the Soviet Union, which collapsed in 1991.

>However, Deng is also remembered for human rights violations and for numerous instances of political violence. As paramount leader, he oversaw the Tiananmen Square massacre; afterwards, he was influential in the Communist Party's domestic cover-up of the event. Furthermore, he is associated with some of the worst purges during Mao Zedong's rule; for instance, he ordered an army crackdown on a Muslim village in Yunnan which resulted in the deaths of 1,600 people, including 300 children.”

>“Doubts about the existence of free will and individuals are nothing new, of course. More than 2,000 years ago thinkers in India, China and Greece argued that ‘the individual self is an illusion’. Yet such doubts don’t really change history much unless they have a practical impact on economics, politics and day-to-day life. **Humans are masters of cognitive dissonance**, and we allow ourselves to believe one thing in the laboratory and an altogether different thing in the courthouse or in parliament. Just as Christianity didn’t disappear the day Darwin published On the Origin of Species, so liberalism won’t vanish just because scientists have reached the conclusion that there are no free individuals.”

Buddha’s recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings.”

>“Understanding human history in the millennia following the Agricultural Revolution boils down to a single question: **how did humans organise themselves in mass-cooperation networks, when they lacked the biological instincts** necessary to sustain such networks?

But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.”

>“Capitalism did not defeat communism because capitalism was more ethical, because individual liberties are sacred or because God was angry with the heathen communists. Rather, capitalism won the Cold War because distributed data processing works better than centralised data processing, at least in periods of accelerating technological change. The central committee of the Communist Party just could not deal with the rapidly changing world of the late twentieth century. When all data is accumulated in one secret bunker, and all important decisions are taken by a group of elderly apparatchiks, they can produce nuclear bombs by the cartload, but not an Apple or a Wikipedia.”

>“Today more than ninety per cent of all large animals are domesticated. Consider the chicken, for example. Ten thousand years ago it was a rare bird confined to small niches of South Asia. Today billions of chickens live on almost every continent and island, bar Antarctica. The domesticated chicken is probably the most widespread bird in the annals of planet Earth. If you measure success in terms of numbers, chickens, cows and pigs are the most successful animals ever. Alas, **domesticated species paid for their unparalleled collective success with unprecedented individual suffering**.”

>“Yet from the viewpoint of the herd, rather than that of the shepherd, it’s hard to avoid the impression that **for the vast majority of domesticated animals, the Agricultural Revolution was a terrible catastrophe**. Their evolutionary ‘success’ is meaningless. A rare wild rhinoceros on the brink of extinction is probably more satisfied than a calf who spends its short life inside a tiny box, fattened to produce juicy steaks. The contented rhinoceros is no less content for being among the last of its kind. **The numerical success of the calf’s species is little consolation for the suffering the individual endures**.”

Whether it is the immune system, various enzyme systems, the uptake of carcinogens into the cells, or hormonal activities, animal protein generally only causes mischief. High fat intake still can be a problem, and we ought not to be consuming such high-fat diets. But I suggest that animal protein is more problematic in this whole diet/disease relationship than is total fat.”

>“The day has been, I am sad to say in many places it is not yet past, in which the greater part of the species, under the denomination of slaves, have been treated by the law exactly upon the same footing, as, in England for example, the inferior races of animals are still. **The day may come when the rest of the animal creation may acquire those rights which never could have been witholden from them but by the hand of tyranny**. The French have already discovered that the blackness of the skin is no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognised that the number of the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? **The question is not, Can they reason? nor, Can they talk? but, Can they suffer?**” [1780]

Z: I consider this an evil, but not a crime, because I do not cause or wish them to be there, and would assist them to escape if possible. They have no more claim to the water than I have; and we know so little of the nature of these animals, that we are not even sure that they die when the water is drunk; the very fact of their being there is concealed from us, and but for the microscope we should never have known it.

It is known that wolves will live in the two ways mentioned, when deprived of other means.”

>“Yet it must be confessed that whichever way we turn our eyes we see a system of aggression and destruction. In order for one animal to live, thousands must die: directly so if the one be carnivorous, and indirectly so if graminivorous. It has been calculated that some birds destroy thousands of butterflies during the rearing of a single brood; and if we take man, who is half carnivorous, and calculate how many lives are destroyed to maintain him in comfort during his life, even without sport, the number will appear enormous, no estimate of which can however be made without taking into account the size of the animals he feeds on.”

>“The emancipation of men from cruelty and injustice will bring with it in due course the emancipation of animals also. The two reforms are inseparably connected, and neither can be fully realized alone.” [1897]

>“If "rights" exist at all—and both feeling and usage indubitably prove that they do exist—they cannot be consistently awarded to men and denied to animals, since the same sense of justice and compassion apply in both cases.” [1894]

>“Have the lower animals "rights?" Undoubtedly—if men have.” [1894]

>“[The] notion of the life of an animal having 'no moral purpose,' belongs to a class of ideas which cannot possibly be accepted by the advanced humanitarian thought of the present day [1894] —it is a purely arbitrary assumption, at variance with our best instincts, at variance with our best science, and absolutely fatal (if the subject be clearly thought out) to any full realization of animals' rights. If we are ever going to do justice to the lower races, we must get rid of the antiquated notion of a 'great gulf' fixed between them and mankind, and must recognize the common bond of humanity that unites **all living beings in one universal brotherhood**.”

>“We have to decide, not whether the practice of fox-hunting, for example, is more, or less, cruel than vivisection, but whether all practices which inflict unnecessary pain on sentient beings are not incompatible with the higher instincts of humanity.”

>“Oppression and cruelty are invariably founded on a lack of imaginative sympathy; the tyrant or tormentor can have no true sense of kinship with the victim of his injustice. When once the sense of affinity is awakened, the knell of tyranny is sounded, and the ultimate concession of "rights" is simply a matter of time.”

>“I say ethical principle, because it is beyond doubt that the chief motive of Vegetarianism is the humane one. Questions of hygiene and of economy both play their part, and an important part, in a full discussion of food reform; but the feeling which underlies and animates the whole movement is the instinctive horror of butchery, especially the butchery of the more highly organized animals, so human, so near akin to man.”

>“It is often said, as an excuse for the slaughter of animals, that it is better for them to live and to be butchered than not to live at all. … In fact, if we once admit that it is an advantage to an animal to be brought into the world, there is hardly any treatment that cannot be justified by the supposed terms of such a contract. Also, the argument must apply to mankind. It has, in fact, been the plea of the **slave-breeder**; and it is logically just as good an excuse for slave-holding as for flesh-eating. It would justify parents in almost any treatment of their children, who owe them, for the great boon of life, a debt of gratitude which no subsequent services can repay. We could hardly deny the same merit to cannibals, if they were to breed their human victims for the table, as the early Peruvians are said to have done.”

>“I shall die ... as I have lived, rationalist, socialist, pacifist, and humanitarian.”

>“Religion has never befriended the cause of humaneness. Its monstrous doctrine of eternal punishment and the torture of the damned underlies **much of the barbarity with which man has treated man**; and the deep division imagined by the Church between the human being, with his immortal soul, and the soulless "beasts", has been responsible for an incalculable sum of cruelty.”

But it was not until after the age of Rousseau, from which must be dated the great humanitarian movement of the past century, that Vegetarianism began to assert itself as a system, a reasoned plea for the disuse of flesh-food.”

For **factory-farming** is **not just cruel**; it's **energy-inefficient**. Let’s take just one example. Over the past few decades, millions of Ethiopians have died of "food shortages" while Ethiopia grew grain to sell to the West to feed cattle. Western meat-eating habits **prop up the price of grain so that poor people in the developing world can’t afford to buy it**. In consequence, they starve by the millions.

>“The very saddest sound in all my memory was burned into my awareness at age five on my uncle's dairy farm in Wisconsin. A cow had given birth to a beautiful male calf. The mother was allowed to nurse her calf but for a single night. On the second day after birth, my uncle took the calf from the mother and placed him in the veal pen in the barn—only ten yards away, in plain view of the mother. The mother cow could see her infant, smell him, hear him, but could not touch him, comfort him, or nurse him. The heartrending bellows that she poured forth—minute after minute, hour after hour, for five long days—were excruciating to listen to. They are the most poignant and painful auditory memories I carry in my brain. Since that age, whenever I hear anyone postulate that animals cannot really feel emotions, I need only to replay that torturous sound in my memory of that mother cow crying her bovine heart out to her infant. Mother's love knows no species barriers, and I believe that all people who are vegans in their hearts and souls know that to be true.”

Perhaps because comparisons between women and nonhuman animals so often entail sexism, many women are anxious to distance themselves from other animals. Feminists, especially, recognize that negative "animal" imagery has advanced women's oppression. However, if our treatment and view of other animals became caring, respectful, and just, nonhuman-animal metaphors would quickly lose all power to demean. Few women have confronted how closely they mirror patriarchal oppressors when they too participate in other species' denigration.

Will our tyranny continue, proving that morality counts for nothing when it clashes with selfinterest, as the most cynical of poets and philosophers have always said? Or will we rise to the challenge and prove our capacity for genuine altruism by ending our ruthless exploitation of the species in our power, not because we are forced to do so by rebels or terrorists, but because we recognize that our position is morally indefensible? The way in which we answer this question depends on the way in which each one of us, individually, answers it.”

>“Ethics is inescapable.”

>“One common strategy on which we should all be able to agree is to take steps to reduce the risk of human extinction when those steps are also highly effective in benefiting existing sentient beings. For example, eliminating or decreasing the consumption of animal products will benefit animals, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lessen the chances of a pandemic resulting from a virus evolving among the animals crowded into today’s factory farms, which are an ideal breeding ground for viruses. That therefore looks like a high-priority strategy.”[^COVID]

>“When we buy new clothes not to keep ourselves warm but to look "well-dressed" we are not providing for any important need. We would not be sacrificing anything significant if we were to continue to wear our old clothes, and give the money to famine relief. By doing so, we would be preventing another person from starving. It follows from what I have said earlier that we ought to give money away, rather than spend it on clothes which we do not need to keep us warm. To do so is not charitable, or generous. Nor is it the kind of act which philosophers and theologians have called "supererogatory" - an act which it would be good to do, but not wrong not to do. On the contrary, we ought to give the money away, and it is wrong not to do so.”

>“There can be no brotherhood when some nations indulge in previously unheard of luxuries, while others struggle to stave off famine.”

>“My students often ask me if I think their parents did wrong to pay the <span>$</span>44,000 per year that it costs to send them to Princeton. I respond that paying that much for a place at an elite university is not justified unless it is seen as an investment in the future that will benefit not only one’s child, but others as well. An outstanding education provides students with the skills, qualifications, and understanding to do more for the world than would otherwise be the case. It is good for the world as a whole if there are more people with these qualities. Even if going to Princeton does no more than open doors to jobs with higher salaries, that, too, is a benefit that can be spread to others, as long as after graduating you remain firm in the resolve to contribute a percentage of that salary to organizations working for the poor, and spread this idea among your highly paid colleagues. The danger, of course, is that your colleagues will instead persuade you that you can’t possibly drive anything less expensive than a BMW and that you absolutely must live in an impressively large apartment in one of the most expensive parts of town.”

>“September 11, 2001, was just another day for most of the world’s desperately poor people, so presumably close to 30,000 children under five died from these causes on that day—about ten times the number of victims of the terrorist attacks. The publication of these figures did not lead to an avalanche of money for UNICEF or other aid agencies helping to reduce infant mortality. In the year 2000 Americans made private donations for foreign aid of all kinds totalling about <span>$</span>4 per person in extreme poverty, or roughly <span>$</span>20 per family. New Yorkers who were living in lower Manhattan on September 11, 2001, whether wealthy or not, were able to receive an average of <span>$</span>5,300 per family. The distance between these amounts encapsulates the way in which, for many people, the circle of concern for others stops at the boundaries of their own country—if it extends even that far.” [The "[drowning child](https://www.philosophyexperiments.com/singer/){:target="_blank"}" thought experiment]

>“According to conservative estimates, 200 million land animals and 2 billion sea animals are killed "Every day* for food. Think about the scale of that violence. Think about the insidious way in which this numbs us to all violence.”

>“We proclaim human intelligence to be morally valuable per se because we are human. If we were birds, we would proclaim the ability to fly as morally valuable per se. If we were fish, we would proclaim the ability to live underwater as morally valuable per se. But apart from our obviously self-interested proclamations, there is nothing morally valuable per se about human intelligence.”

>“If animals have moral value, they must have one right-the right not to be property. If they do not have this one right, their interests in not suffering will be devalued or ignored. Their interest in their lives will be ignored.
>
>Recognizing the right of animals not to be property does not protect nonhuman animals from all suffering and death any more than the right of humans not to be property protects them from all suffering and death. But in both cases, the right protects the rightholders from all suffering incidental to use exclusively as a resource.”

>“When we promote welfare reform, we necessarily promote the idea that it is morally desirable to consume the more 'humane' product or engage in the more 'humane' use. Welfare reform campaigns necessarily promote exploitation. Welfare reform campaigns necessarily perpetuate speciesism.”

>“Peter Singer says that if you're a vegan sitting with nonvegan friends in a restaurant and your food comes with cheese on it, you should just shut up and eat it so your friends don't think that being a vegan is difficult. I say that if you eat it, you have just taught your friends that veganism is not something to be taken seriously as a moral matter.”

>“One of the main arguments that I make is that although almost everyone accepts that it is morally wrong to inflict "**unnecessary**" suffering and death on animals, 99% of the suffering and death that we inflict on animals can be justified only by our pleasure, amusement, or convenience. For example, the best justification that we have for killing the billions of nonhumans that we eat every year is that we enjoy the taste of animal flesh and animal products. This is not an acceptable justification if we take seriously, as we purport to, that it is wrong to inflict unnecessary suffering or death on animals, and it illustrates the confused thinking that I characterize as our "moral schizophrenia" when it comes to nonhumans.”

>“If you think it's difficult to be vegan, imagine how difficult it is for the billions of animals we torture and kill that you're not vegan.”

>“It doesn't matter if they had the best lives in the world. Killing an animal so you can eat the animal or wear the animal is wrong.”

>“'But veganism is elitist.' What complete nonsense. Elitism involves promoting a perceived superiority of some sort. It involves the idea of according less moral value to the 'inferior.' As two seconds of thinking make clear, veganism is not elitist in any way. On the contrary. Veganism is about rejecting the idea that it is morally acceptable to exploit sentient nonhumans because they are 'inferior.' Nonvegans believe in the 'inferiority' of animals. It is they who embrace elitism.”

>“You don't have to love animals to recognize that it is immoral and unjust to exploit them. But if you do love animals, and you continue to participate in their exploitation, you need to rethink your idea of what love means.”

>“A question I got: "Why don't you support veganuary?"
>
>Answer: being vegan is about justice and the fundamental rights of nonhumans-nothing less. You don't encourage people to stop being racist or sexist for a month. You make it clear that racism and sexism are always wrong.”

>“Just as you will never get people to go vegan by shouting at them, you will also fail if you say it's fine to be a nonvegan on a "reducetarian journey" who does Meatless Monday, etc. You need to be clear: It's not a moral option. No "journeys." Veganism is a moral imperative.”

>“Animal exploitation is the single most spiritually destructive, morally bankrupt, environmentally devastating, and physically unhealthy thing that we do.”

>“To say that animals are not property because you love your nonhuman companions is like saying that your car is not your property because you choose to wash and wax it every week and keep it in splendid condition. You car is your property. You can choose to put a great deal of money and energy into maintaining it. Or you can do nothing more than what is required to have the car pass a safety inspection. The same applies to your nonhuman companions. You can choose to treat them as members of your family. Or you can dump them at a shelter or have a vet kill them. They are [legally] your property.”

>“Consuming animal products is a 'choice' only insofar as society allows you to choose to do things that are obviously and indisputably morally wrong. Are you free to choose to hold racist views? Yes, you are. Is it morally wrong to judge others solely by their skin colour? Yes, of course it is. So saying that something is a 'choice' says nothing about its morality. We cannot morally justify consuming animal products. Period. Consuming those products may be a matter of 'choice' but only in a most superficial sense. It is not a matter of choice for anyone who takes morality seriously.”

>“Vegetarianism is a morally incoherent position. There is no morally coherent distinction between meat and other animal foods. They all involve suffering, death, and injustice. If you care morally about animals, veganism is the only rational response.”

>“There is really is no escaping that, if you are not vegan, you are treating animals as things without moral value. This means that your claim to take animals seriously and regard them as beings with moral value is bullshit (apologies to bulls). So stop already. Go vegan. Today. Now.”

>“Veganism is about nonviolence. It is about refusing to participate in inflicting completely unjustifiable harm on the vulnerable. Please go vegan.”

>“The idea that we have the right to inflict suffering and death on other sentient beings for the trivial reasons of palate pleasure and fashion is, without doubt, one of the most arrogant and morally repugnant notions in the history of human thought.”

>“The task facing ARAs (Animal Rights Advocates) is daunting: **we must empty the cages, not make them larger**.”

>“The less gifted do not exist to serve the interests of the more gifted. The former are not mere things when compared to the latter, to be used as means to the latter's ends. From the moral point of view, each of us is equal because each of us is equally a somebody, not a something, the subject-of-a-life, not a life without a subject.”

>“What I had learned about human rights proved to be directly relevant to my thinking about animal rights. Whether any animals have rights depends on the true answer to one question: Are any animals **subjects-of-a-life**? This is the question that needs to be asked about animals because this is the question we need to ask about us.”

>“And they say ARAs are violent. The bitter truth would be laughable if it were not so tragic. The violence done to things by some ARAs (buy which I mean the violent destruction of insensate property) is nothing compared to the violence done to feeling creatures by the major animal user industries. A raindrop compared to an ocean. On a day-to-day basis, by far the greatest amount of violence done in the "civilized" world occurs because of what humans do to other animals. That the violence is legally protected, that in some cases (for example, vivisection) it is socially esteemed, only serves to make matters worse.”

>“Then there are those proverbial “bird brains” of the barnyard, chickens, surely **the most maligned and abused animal on the face of the earth**, and—just as surely—among the brightest, most social birds we'll find anywhere. … Chickens not only are capable of learning, they are also capable of teaching one another. It turns out that chickens are not as dumb as popular mythology makes them out to be.”

>“From my reading of Gandhi I had learned how some people in India regard eating cow as unspeakably repulsive. I realized I felt the same way about cats and dogs: I could never eat them. Were cows so different from cats and dogs that there were two moral standards, one that applies to cows, another that applies to cats and dogs? Were pigs so different? Were any of the animals I ate so different?”

>“Philosophers have written more about animal rights in the past twenty years than their predecessors wrote in the previous two thousand. Not surprisingly, disagreements abound. To begin with, among those who challenge attributing moral rights to animals are philosophers who operate within well- worn moral traditions in Western thought. Peter Singer (1975, 1999) and Carl Cohen (1986, 1996, 1997) are representative. Singer follows in the tradition of the nineteenth-century English utilitarian Jeremy Bentham, who ridicules moral rights as "nonsense upon stilts." For both Bentham and Singer, not only nonhuman animals but also humans lack moral rights. This is half-true, maintains Cohen. Animals, he argues, most certainly do not have moral rights, but Bentham and Singer err when they deny that humans have them. Nothing could be further from the truth. According to Cohen, not just some but all humans possess basic rights, including the rights to life and to bodily integrity.” [<a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/REGDAR" target="_blank"> Regan (2001), p. 67.</a> The reason for this increase is largely due to his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Case_for_Animal_Rights" target="_blank">1983 book</a>.]

I feel like a massive hole tore through my heart.<br>
The thought of never seeing you again fills me with so much sadness. I've admired you so much since I was a child.<br>
I distinctly remember the day you called me by name for the first time.<br>
I remember that day walking home, hanging out with Kishimoto-san,<br>
when you called us "friends" for the first time.<br>
And I remember the last conversation we had.<br>
Picking up the relay from an age when reading manga was considered a stupid waste of time, you are among those that forged an era where both adults and children alike could read and enjoy this medium. Showing me that manga could achieve such things...
you made me dream that I could reach the whole world.
I felt as if I was witnessing a real superhero pushing forward.<br>
Your impact wasn't limited to the manga industry alone.<br>
The childhoods of so many creators from several industries<br>
were no doubt rooted in the excitement of reading Dragon Ball weekly.<br>
Your existence is like a great tree whose branches spread into the sky.<br>
To mangaka of our generation like us, standing on the same stage as he did and the closer we got to Toriyama's work, the more I feel we realized just how much of a presence it had on this industry.
It was almost frightening to witness.<br>
And yet at the same time, the man behind it was such an easygoing person. That made me so happy to see.
I feel that, on a genetic level, we all love Toriyama-sensei for who he was.
I would like to offer my deepest respect and gratitude for the vibrant creative world that Toriyama-sensei left behind, and pray from the bottom of my heart that he may rest in peace.<br><br>

[^EinsteinNotLazy]: I used to think he was a lazy guy in my childhood. The quote is from <a href="https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol8-trans/176" target="_blank">this letter</a> written a week before he published the correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations" target="_blank">field equations of General Relativity (GR) or EFE</a>. At that point in time, he was very afraid that GR would be formulated by someone before him. Indeed, it happened as he feared and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity_priority_dispute#Undisputed_facts" target="_blank">Hilbert probably found the correct field equations</a> ( $R_{\mu \nu }-{\frac {1}{2}}Rg_{\mu \nu }={\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }$ the cosmological constant came later) independently 5 days before him. Even if Hilbert actually found the complete equations before him, he would still be the <b>single biggest contributor</b> to the formulation of GR because he found the equations without the trace term(i.e. $R_{\mu \nu }={\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }$) first and was aware that he should add some term to make both sides consistent since $\nabla_{\nu} T^{\mu \nu}=0$ but $\nabla_{\nu} R^{\mu \nu }\neq 0$. Also Hilbert fully credited Einstein as the originator of the theory and no public priority dispute concerning the field equations ever arose between the two men during their lives.

[^Gandhi]: Einstein severely overestimated Gandhi. I think Nehru is far greater political leader than Gandhi.

[^Hilbert]: Based on [this letter](https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol8-trans/190){:target="_blank"} between them, it seems even though they never publicly stated it, privately there was a slight misunderstanding between Einstein and Hilbert about their expected fraction of credit on general relativity even if Hilbert never complained publicly.

[^NewtonAtheism]:
    This “I have studied these things — you have not.” was Newton's response when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_Halley" target="_blank">Edmond Halley</a> mocked religion or alchemy. Newton once said on atheism:

    >“Atheism is so senseless & odious to mankind that it never had many professors. Can it be by accident that all birds beasts & men have their right side & left side alike shaped (except in their bowels) & just two eyes & no more on either side the face & just two ears on either side the head & a nose with two holes & no more between the eyes & one mouth under the nose & either two fore leggs or two wings or two arms on the sholders & two leggs on the hipps one on either side & no more? Whence arises this uniformity in all their outward shapes but from the counsel & contrivance of an Author? Whence is it that the eyes of all sorts of living creatures are transparent to the very bottom & the only transparent members in the body, having on the outside an hard transparent skin, & within transparent juyces with a crystalline Lens in the middle & a pupil before the Lens all of them so truly shaped & fitted for vision, that no Artist can mend them? Did blind chance know that there was light & what was its refraction & fit the eyes of all creatures after the most curious manner to make use of it? These & such like considerations always have & ever will prevail with man kind to believe that there is a being who made all things & has all things in his power & who is therfore to be feared.”

    Newton is widely considered as one of the top 2 physicists of all time (the other being Einstein. Example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Landau#Landau's_ranking_of_physicists" target="_blank">Landau's ranking of physicists</a>). You may ask: 'How could someone that intelligent believe in something as silly as religion?'. But we should understand that the questions above were unexplainable back in those days as **biology was not mature enough** to answer them. So, **Newton had valid excuses to utter such nonsense**. He also believed in Alchemy and <a href="https://www.livescience.com/54162-newton-recipe-for-philosophers-stone-rediscovered.html" target="_blank">was interested in making the philosopher's stone</a>. To be honest, if I believed that philosopher'sphilosopher's stone could exist, I would also definitely try to make it and become **immortal**.

    >Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind that looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10 000 years ago.”

[^Dirac]: This was Dirac's opinion at the 1927 Solvay Conference when they were talking about religion. I 100% agree with him on this.

[^Chandrasekhar]: This statement was made considering GR, a classical theory. It was written in 1983 (9 years after Hawking radiation was predicted) in the preface of his book. Maybe he was unaware of the humongous number of states needed for a black hole to interpret the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy statistically unlike in GR where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-hair_theorem" target="_blank">No-hair theorem</a> restricts the degrees of freedom.

[^Bruno]: His reply before he was burned to death because he rejected Catholic doctrines, embraced pantheism and for his cosmological theories.

[^HilbertPhysics]: He meant mathematicians like him should become part time physicists and help physicists otherwise physicists can't do it.

[^HilbertIgnorabimus]: He was not aware of Gödel's incompleteness theorems when saying this.

[^HilbertSpace]: Even though Hilbert studied them first, he was not aware at that time during a talk by von Neumann that they named these spaces after him.

[^suffering]: It is second of the Four Noble Truths mentioned in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammacakkappavattana_Sutta" target="_blank">Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</a>. I think it is somewhat of an exaggeration because there are things like natural disasters which are not caused by desires. But I still think this is an important argument.

[^demand]: Gautama lived as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asceticism" target="_blank">ascetic</a> beggar (bhikṣu) and he ate whatever people gave him including meat because it is leftover food. Here he is trying to explain that we should not increase demand for meat which will increase demand for unnecessary suffering. What is remarkable is that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand#History" target="_blank">supply and demand</a> economic concept was first explained in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kural" target="_blank">Tirukkuṟaḷ</a> (300 BCE to 500 CE) few centuries after Gautama's death. Gautama intuitively understood this concept even before it was first stated. Looks like he was at least decently smart.

[^logic]: Taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesamutti_Sutta" target="_blank">Kesamutti Sutta</a>. Often times some people misinterpret this quote to portray Buddhism as a religion based on logic, even though Gautama stated that one should not determine the validity of a statement "by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought". It's certainly better than most religions, but portraying it as a religion based on logic/rationality is disingenuous.

[^Gautama]: His title "Buddha" (awakened one) was given two centuries after his death. He lived between 563–483 BCE. I am an atheist. I do not support the ***unscientific*** Buddhism. But I still think Siddhārtha Gautama was a good philosopher. You can read my views on religion <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2020/05/views-on-religion.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

[^Voltaire]: This statement is obviously wrong. The most precious gift is the [Indian numeral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system){:target="_blank"}. It is often wrongly called as Arabic numeral system. Vedas are useless in comparison to the Indian numeral system.

[^COVID]: Stated on 2015, before COVID-19 pandemic.

[^Oda]: This was Oda's response to the death of Akira Toriyama. He is, in many ways, Toriyama's successor (who himself was the successor of Osamu Tezuka) as the greatest shōnen mangaka of their generation.

[^Nehru]: Nehru really understood where India was heading better than any other freedom fighter. He rightly guessed that Hindu fanaticism would take over India. The fact that the Indians of the 1940s voted him as the prime minister despite him being an atheist who used to publicly state his criticism of religion astonishes me. He was the only good prime minister India has ever had.

[^Hume]: Hume here found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem" target="_blank">Is–ought problem</a>. One of the deepest ethical problems.

[^Neurath]: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurath%27s_boat" target="_blank">Neurath's boat</a>: a simile used in anti-foundational philosophy. You can't just make the boat from scratch by swimming because [philosophical skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism){:target="_blank"} is like a shark that will eat you if you enter the water. Even if you know swimming, you can't build the boat from scratch because the shark will eat you. So, you can't have a single foundation and must use a mixture of reason, empirical data etc.

[^Weinberg]: You should believe when Weinberg says this. He is not a string theorist. He didn't devote his life to string theory. He has his own theory called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_safety_in_quantum_gravity" target="_blank">asymptotic safety</a>. Yet he is telling string theory is the "only game in town". Compare this to <a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/" target="_blank">bloggers</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SabineHossenfelder" target="_blank">social media influencers</a> who never studied string theory properly but spread their unfounded criticism.

[^Skepticism]: The first line from [The Problems of Philosophy](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=F3CABBiwm6wC&newbks=0&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false){:target="_blank"}. The answer is <span style="color:red">***most probably***</span> no. If I haven’t included <span style="color:red">***most probably***</span>, that sentence itself will become some knowledge.

[^Salt]: Salt correctly predicted this in 1897. Humanity is using the advances in technology to breed even more sentient animals and enslave them and do even more barbarically cruel things instead of using that technology to make it so that we will never again have to enslave other sentient animals, which is not hard to achieve with our current technology. To become an honorable species, abolishing animal agriculture is not enough and we should try to do whatever we can to solve the problem of [wild animal suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_animal_suffering){:target="_blank"}.

[^Fiction]: From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_True_Story" target="_blank">A True Story</a> (2nd century AD) the first sci-fi story and also the first fictional story where it was explicitly stated as fiction. Before this the concept of fiction was not there. He explictly mentioned that the story is lies and not true just in case it might become mythology.
