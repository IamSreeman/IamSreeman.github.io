### Physicists

>“I worked horribly strenuously, strange that one can endure that.”<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>

>“People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a **stubbornly persistent illusion.**”

>“I believe with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank">Schopenhauer</a>: ***We can do what we wish, but we can only wish what we must***. Practically, I am, nevertheless, compelled to act as if freedom of the will existed. If I wish to live in a civilized community, I must act as if man is a responsible being. I know that philosophically a murderer is not responsible for his crime; nevertheless, I must protect myself from unpleasant contacts. I may consider him guiltless, but I prefer not to take tea with him.”

>“It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. **I do not believe in a personal God** and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.”

>“I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modelled after our own — a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbour such thoughts through **fear or ridiculous egotisms**.”

>“Any man who reads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank">Albert Einstein</a>

>“Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler" target="_blank">John Archibald Wheeler</a>

>“If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9" target="_blank">Henri Poincaré</a>

>“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">Isaac Newton</a>

>“Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. ***What one fool can do, another can.***”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvanus_P._Thompson" target="_blank">Silvanus P. Thompson</a>

>“The black holes of nature are **the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe**: the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time. And since the general theory of Relativity provides only a single unique family of solutions for their descriptions, they are the simplest objects as well.”<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar" target="_blank">Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</a>

>“Black holes ain't as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought. Things can get out of a black hole, both to the outside, and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up. There's a way out.”

>“We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can **understand the Universe**. That makes us something very special.”

>“I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first ... I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" target="_blank">Stephen Hawking</a>

>“I cannot understand why we idle discussing **religion**. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of **false assertions**, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why **primitive people**, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling.
>
>But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the **postulate** of an **Almighty God** helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit.
>
>Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of **all mortal sins**.”<sup id="a3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac" target="_blank">P.A.M Dirac</a>


>“Religion is an insult to **human dignity**. Without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.But for good people to do evil things, that takes **religion**.”

>“I think the world needs to wake up from its long nightmare of religious belief; and anything that we scientists can do to ***weaken the hold of religion*** should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.

>“I have a friend — or had a friend, now dead — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam" target="_blank">Abdus Salam</a>, a very devout Muslim, who was trying to bring science into the universities in the Gulf states and he told me that he had a terrible time because, although they were very receptive to technology, they felt that science would be a corrosive to religious belief, and they were worried about it... and damn it, I think they were right. ***It is corrosive of religious belief, and it's a good thing too***.”

>“The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more **it also seems pointless**.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg" target="_blank">Steven Weinberg</a>

>“All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei" target="_blank">Galileo Galilei</a>

>“Physics is too hard for physicists.”<sup id="a4"><a href="#f4">4</a></sup>

>“But he (Galileo) was not an idiot,... **Only an idiot could believe that scientific truth needs martyrdom** — that may be necessary in religion, but scientific results prove themselves in time.”

>“If I were to awaken after having slept for a thousand years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?”

>“We must not believe those, who today, with philosophical bearing and deliberative tone, prophesy the fall of culture and accept the [ignorabimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoramus_et_ignorabimus). For us there is no ignorabimus, and in my opinion none whatever in natural science. In opposition to the foolish ignorabimus our slogan shall be:
>
>We must know — we will know!”<sup id="a5"><a href="#f5">5</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Hilbert" target="_blank">David Hilbert</a>

>“I had no need of that hypothesis.” [When Napoleon said “Laplace, they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the universe, and have never even mentioned its Creator”]

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace" target="_blank">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a>

>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana" target="_blank">Nirvana</a> is a state of pure blissful knowledge... It has nothing to do with the individual. The ego or its separation is an illusion. Indeed in a certain sense two "I"'s are identical namely when one disregards all special contents — their Karma. The goal of man is to preserve his Karma and to develop it further... when man dies his Karma lives and creates for itself another carrier.”

>“In itself, the insight is not new. The earliest records, to my knowledge, date back some 2500 years or more... the recognition **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)" target="_blank">ATMAN</a> = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman" target="_blank">BRAHMAN</a>** (the personal self equals the omnipresent, all-comprehending eternal self) was in Indian thought considered, far from being blasphemous, to represent the quintessence of deepest insight into the happenings of the world. The striving of all the scholars of Vedanta was after having learnt to pronounce with their lips, really assimilate in their minds this grandest of all thoughts.
>
>Again, the mystics of many centuries, independently, yet in perfect harmony with each other (somewhat like the particles in an ideal gas) have described, each of them, the unique experience of his or her life in terms that can be condensed in the phrase: DEUS FACTUS SUM (I have become God).To Western ideology, the thought has remained a stranger...”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger" target="_blank">Erwin Schrödinger</a>


>“I was born not knowing and have had only a **little time** to change that here and there.”

>“From a long view of the history of mankind — seen from, say, ten thousand years from now — there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell's discovery of the laws of electrodynamics. The American Civil War will **pale** into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade.”

>“It doesn't seem to me that this fantastically marvellous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions, and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil — which is the view that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama.”

>“God was always invented to explain mystery. God is always invented to explain those things that you do not understand. Now when you finally discover how something works, you get some laws which you're taking away from God; you don't need him anymore. But you need him for the other mysteries. So therefore you leave him to create the universe because we haven't figured that out yet; you need him for understanding those things which you don't believe the laws will explain, such as consciousness, or why you only live to a certain length of time — life and death — stuff like that. God is always associated with those things that you do not understand. Therefore I don't think that the laws can be considered to be like God because they have been figured out.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a>

>“Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie" target="_blank">Marie Curie</a>


>“In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.”

>“If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electron remains the same, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether the electron's position changes with time, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether the electron is at rest, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say 'no'. **The Buddha** has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of a man's self after his death; but they are not familiar answers for the tradition of seventeenth and eighteenth century science.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer" target="_blank">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>

>“It is just as foolish to complain that people are selfish and treacherous as it is to complain that the magnetic field does not increase unless the electric field has a curl. Both are laws of nature.”

>“Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann" target="_blank">John von Neumann</a>

>“A possible explanation of the physicist's use of mathematics to formulate his laws of nature is that he is a somewhat irresponsible person. As a result, when he finds a connection between two quantities which resembles a connection well-known from mathematics, he will jump at the conclusion that the connection is that discussed in mathematics simply because he does not know of any other similar connection.”

>“The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither ***understand*** nor ***deserve***.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Wigner" target="_blank">Eugene Wigner</a>

>“It is a great pity that human beings cannot find all of their satisfaction in scientific contemplativeness.”

>“It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about nature...”

>“Every sentence I utter must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question.”

>“I am absolutely prepared to talk about the spiritual life of an electronic computer: to state that it is reflecting or is in a bad mood... The question whether the machine really feels or ponders, or whether it merely looks as though it did, is of course absolutely meaningingless.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr" target="_blank">Niels Bohr</a>

>“Niels Bohr brain-washed a whole generation of physicists into believing that the problem had been solved fifty years ago [comment on the Copenhagen interpretation].”

>“I thought of killing myself but soon decided that I could always try MIT and then kill myself later if it was that bad but that I couldn't commit suicide and then try MIT afterwards. The two operations, suicide and going to MIT, don't commute...”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann" target="_blank">Murray Gell-Mann</a>

>“The question of the origin of the matter in the universe is no longer thought to be beyond the range of science — everything can be created from nothing…it is fair to say that the universe is the ultimate free lunch.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Guth" target="_blank">Alan Guth</a>

>“There are countless suns and countless earths all rotating round their suns in exactly the same way as the seven planets of our system.”

>“You may be more afraid to bring that sentence against me than I am to accept it.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giordano_Bruno" target="_blank">Giordano Bruno</a>

>“Science flies you to the moon. Religion flies you into buildings.”

>“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of **confident religions**, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
>
>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a **fraction of a dot**.
>
>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
>
>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.
>
>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores ***our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot***, the only home we've ever known.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan" target="_blank">Carl Sagan</a>

>“Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.”

### Philosophers

>“**Desires** are the root cause of **sadness**.”<sup id="a6"><a href="#f6">6</a></sup>

>“I say that there are three instances in which meat should not be consumed: when it is seen, heard, or suspected [that the animal was killed for one’s sake]. These are the three instances in which I say that meat should not be consumed.”

>“How then can it be compassionate to gorge on other beings’ blood and flesh? Monks who will not wear silks from the East, whether coarse or fine; who will not wear shoes or boots of leather, nor furs, nor birds’ down from our own country; and who will not consume milk, curds, or ghee, have truly freed themselves from the world.”

>“Death carries off a man who is gathering flowers and whose mind is distracted, as a flood carries off a sleeping village.”

>“Now, Kalamas,<br>
Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing (anussava),<br>
nor upon tradition (paramparā),<br>
nor upon rumor (itikirā),<br>
nor upon what is in a scripture (piṭaka-sampadāna),<br>
nor upon surmise (takka-hetu),<br>
nor upon an axiom (naya-hetu),<br>
nor upon specious reasoning (ākāra-parivitakka),<br>
nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over (diṭṭhi-nijjhān-akkh-antiyā),<br>
nor upon another's seeming ability (bhabba-rūpatāya),<br>
nor upon the consideration, The monk is our teacher (samaṇo no garū).<br>
Kalamas, when you yourselves know: "These things are good; these things are not blamable; these things are praised by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness," enter on and abide in them.”<sup id="a7"><a href="#f7">7</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha" target="_blank">Gautama Buddha</a> (I do not support main stream ***unscientific*** Buddhism. You can read my views on religion <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2020/05/views-on-religion.html" target="_blank">here</a>.)

>“Skepticism, while logically impeccable, is psychologically impossible, and there is an element of frivolous insincerity in any philosophy which pretends to accept it.”

>“If there were a God, I think it very unlikely that he would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt his existence.”

>“I think all the great religions of the world - Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, and Communism - both untrue and harmful. It is evident as a matter of logic that, since they disagree, not more than one of them can be true. With very few exception, the religions which a man accepts is that of the community in which he lives, which makes it obvious that the influence of environment is what has led him to accept the religion in question.”

>“If everything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just as well be the world as God, so that there cannot be any validity in that argument. It is exactly of the same nature as the Hindu's view, that the world rested upon an elephant and the elephant rested upon a tortoise; and when they said, "How about the tortoise?" the Indian said, "Suppose we change the subject." The argument is really no better than that.”

>“Quite illogically, the victory of Locke’s philosophy in England and France was largely due to the prestige of Newton. Descartes’ authority as a philosopher was enhanced, in his own day, by his work in mathematics and natural philosophy. But his doctrine of vortices was definitely inferior to Newton’s law of gravitation as an explanation of the solar system. The victory of the Newtonian cosmogony diminished men’s respect for Descartes and increased their respect for England. Both these causes inclined men favourably towards Locke.”

>“In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge the governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%E2%80%93Einstein_Manifesto" target="_blank">Russell–Einstein Manifesto</a>)

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" target="_blank">Bertrand Russell</a>

>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus" target="_blank">Epicurus</a>’s old questions are yet unanswered. Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?”

>“Ignorance is the mother of Devotion.”

>“Survey most nations and most ages. Examine the religious principles, which have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be persuaded, that they are any thing but sick men's dreams: Or perhaps will regard them more as the playsome whimsies of monkies in human shape, than the serious, positive, dogmatical asseverations of a being, who dignifies himself with the name of rational.”

>“No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous, than the fact which it endeavours to establish.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume" target="_blank">David Hume</a>

>“The chief objection I have to Pantheism is that it says nothing. To call the world "God" is not to explain it; it is only to enrich our language with a superfluous synonym for the word "world".”

>“The bad thing about all religions is that, instead of being able to confess their allegorical nature, they have to conceal it.”

>“Monotheistic religions alone furnish the spectacle of religious wars, religious persecutions, heretical tribunals, that breaking of idols and destruction of images of the gods, that razing of Indian temples and Egyptian colossi, which had looked on the sun 3,000 years: just because a jealous god had said, 'Thou shalt make no graven image.'”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank">Arthur Schopenhauer</a>

>“In order to seek truth, it is necessary once in the course of our life, to doubt, as far as possible, of all things.”

>“I shall then suppose . . . some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon" target="_blank">evil genius</a> not less powerful than deceitful, has employed his whole energies in deceiving me; I shall consider that . . . all . . . external things are but illusions and dreams of which this genius has availed himself to lay traps for my credulity.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" target="_blank">René Descartes</a>

>“We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction.” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurath%27s_boat" target="_blank">Neurath's boat</a>)


― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Neurath" target="_blank">Otto Neurath</a>

>“He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. **And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you**.”

>“I cannot believe in a God who wants to be praised all the time.”

>“The modern scientific counterpart to belief in God is the belief in the universe as an organism: this disgusts me. This is to make what is quite rare and extremely derivative, the organic, which we perceive only on the surface of the earth, into something essential, universal, and eternal! This is still an anthropomorphizing of nature!”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" target="_blank">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>

>“Is the pious being loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is being loved by the gods?”

>“As for me, all I know is that I know nothing.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates" target="_blank">Socrates</a>

>“Religion is too important a matter to its devotees to be a subject of ridicule. If they indulge in absurdities, they are to be pitied rather than ridiculed.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" target="_blank">Immanuel Kant</a>

>“The philosopher has never killed any priests, whereas the priest has killed a great many philosophers.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Diderot" target="_blank">Denis Diderot</a>

>“Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.”

>“It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire" target="_blank">Voltaire</a>

>“The Hiddenness Argument: You’re still a small child, and an amnesiac, but this time you’re in the middle of a vast rain forest, dripping with dangers of various kinds.  You’ve been stuck there for days, trying to figure out who you are and where you came from.  You don’t remember having a mother who accompanied you into this jungle, but in your moments of deepest pain and misery you call for her anyway, ‘Mooooommmmmmm!’  Over and over again.  For days and days … the last time when a jaguar comes at you out of nowhere … but with no response.  What should you think in this situation?  In your dying moments, what should cross your mind?  Would the thought that you have a mother who cares about you and hears your cry and could come to you but chooses not to even make it onto the list?”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._L._Schellenberg" target="_blank">J. L. Schellenberg</a>

>“In the political sense Ashoka had failed; in another sense he had accomplished one of the greatest tasks in history. Within two hundred years after his death Buddhism had spread throughout India, and was entering upon the bloodless conquest of Asia. If to this day, from Kandy in Ceylon to Kamakura in Japan, the placid face of Gautama bids men be gentle to one another and love peace, **it is partly because a dreamer, perhaps a saint, once held the throne of India**.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Durant" target="_blank">Will Durant</a>
### Others

>“Napoleon, and other great men of his type, they were makers of empire. But there is an order of men that get beyond that: They are not makers of empire, but they are makers of universe. And when they have made those universes, their hands are unstained by the blood of any human being on earth. ... Ptolemy made a universe, which lasted 1400 years. Newton also made a universe, which has lasted 300 years. Einstein has made a universe, and I can't tell you how long that will last.”

>“The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality of happiness, and by no means a necessity of life.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw" target="_blank">George Bernard Shaw</a>

>“If there is a God, atheism must strike Him as less of an insult than religion.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_de_Goncourt" target="_blank">Edmond de Goncourt</a>

>“Clarke's three laws:<br>
> 1.When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.<br>
>2.The only way of discovering the limits of the possible is to venture a little way past them into the impossible.<br>
>3.Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.<br>
>As three laws were good enough for Newton, I have modestly decided to stop there”

>“The greatest tragedy in mankind's entire history may be the hijacking of morality by religion.”

>“Science can destroy religion by ignoring it as well as by disproving its tenets. No one ever demonstrated, so far as I am aware, the non-existence of Zeus or Thor — but they have few followers now.”

>“The rash assertion that 'God made man in His own image' is ticking like a time bomb at the foundation of many faiths, and as the hierarchy of the universe is disclosed to us, we may have to recognize this chilling truth: if there are any gods whose chief concern is man, they cannot be very important gods.”

>“Religion is the most malevolent and persistent of all mind viruses. We should get rid of it as quick as we can.”

>“It is not easy to see how the more extreme forms of nationalism can long survive when men have seen the Earth in its true perspective as a single small globe against the stars.”

>“If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.”

>“There is a ~~theory~~ belief which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly ~~what the Universe is for and why it is here~~ how to quantize gravity, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by ~~something even more bizarre and inexplicable~~ a universe in which quantizing gravity is even harder. There is another ~~theory~~ belief which states that this has already happened.” (The original is strickenthrough and edited)

>“Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, "This is an interesting world I find myself in — an interesting hole I find myself in — fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, may have been made to have me in it!" This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for. We all know that at some point in the future the Universe will come to an end and at some other point, considerably in advance from that but still not immediately pressing, the sun will explode. We feel there's plenty of time to worry about that, but on the other hand that's a very dangerous thing to say.”

"Yes," said Richard, "there was also the small matter of gravity."<br>
"Gravity," said Dirk with a slightly dismissive shrug, "yes, there was that as well, I suppose. Though that, of course, was merely a discovery. It was there to be discovered." …<br>
"You see?" he said dropping his cigarette butt, "**They even keep it on at weekends. Someone was bound to notice sooner or later**. But the catflap … ah, there is a very different matter. Invention, pure creative invention. It is a door within a door, you see."”

Measured by our Christianity of to-day, bad as it is, hypocritical as it is, empty and hollow as it is, neither the Deity nor his Son is a Christian, nor qualified for that moderately high place. Ours is a terrible religion. The fleets of the world could swim in spacious comfort in the innocent blood it has spilled.”

>“In some ways people had got used to the idea that India was spiritual and religion-oriented. That gave a leg up to the religious interpretation of India, despite the fact that Sanskrit had a larger atheistic literature than exists in any other classical language. Madhava Acharya, the remarkable 14th century philosopher, wrote this rather great book called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidyaranya#Sarvadar%C5%9Banasa%E1%B9%85graha" target="_blank">Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha</a>, which discussed all the religious schools of thought within the Hindu structure. The first chapter is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charvaka" target="_blank">Cārvāka</a>" or "Atheism"—a very strong presentation of the argument in favour of atheism and materialism.”

>“Ashoka , one of the great monarchs of history, whose dominions extended from Afghanistan to Madras... is the only military monarch on record who abandoned warfare after victory. He had invaded Kalinga (255 B.C.), a country along the east coast of Madras, perhaps with some intention of completing the conquest of the tip of the Indian peninsula. The expedition was successful, but he was disgusted by what be saw of the cruelties and horrors of war. He declared, in certain inscriptions that still exist, that he would no longer seek conquest by war, but by religion, and the rest of his life was devoted to the spreading of Buddhism throughout the world. He seems to have ruled his vast empire in peace and with great ability. **He was no mere religious fanatic. For eight and twenty years Asoka worked sanely for the real needs of men.** In the history of the world there have been thousands of kings and emperors who called themselves "their highnesses," "their majesties," and "their exalted majesties" and so on. They shone for a brief moment, and as quickly disappeared. But Ashoka shines and shines brightly like a bright star, even unto this day.”

>“Doubts about the existence of free will and individuals are nothing new, of course. More than 2,000 years ago thinkers in India, China and Greece argued that ‘the individual self is an illusion’. Yet such doubts don’t really change history much unless they have a practical impact on economics, politics and day-to-day life. Humans are masters of cognitive dissonance, and we allow ourselves to believe one thing in the laboratory and an altogether different thing in the courthouse or in parliament. Just as Christianity didn’t disappear the day Darwin published On the Origin of Species, so liberalism won’t vanish just because scientists have reached the conclusion that there are no free individuals.”

>“Buddha agreed with modern biology and New Age movements that happiness is independent of external conditions. Yet his more important and far more profound insight was that true happiness is also independent of our inner feelings. Indeed, the more significance we give our feelings, the more we crave them, and the more we suffer. Buddha’s recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings.”

>“Understanding human history in the millennia following the Agricultural Revolution boils down to a single question: how did humans organise themselves in mass-cooperation networks, when they lacked the biological instincts necessary to sustain such networks? The short answer is that humans created imagined orders and devised scripts. These two inventions filled the gaps left by our biological inheritance.”

>“History began when humans invented gods, and will end when humans become gods.”

>“How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined.”

>“So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe – and He's ***evil***. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.”

>“Today more than ninety per cent of all large animals are domesticated. Consider the chicken, for example. Ten thousand years ago it was a rare bird confined to small niches of South Asia. Today billions of chickens live on almost every continent and island, bar Antarctica. The domesticated chicken is probably the most widespread bird in the annals of planet Earth. If you measure success in terms of numbers, chickens, cows and pigs are the most successful animals ever. Alas, domesticated species paid for their unparalleled collective success with unprecedented individual suffering.”

>“Yet from the viewpoint of the herd, rather than that of the shepherd, it’s hard to avoid the impression that for the vast majority of domesticated animals, the Agricultural Revolution was a terrible catastrophe. Their evolutionary ‘success’ is meaningless. A rare wild rhinoceros on the brink of extinction is probably more satisfied than a calf who spends its short life inside a tiny box, fattened to produce juicy steaks. The contented rhinoceros is no less content for being among the last of its kind. The numerical success of the calf’s species is little consolation for the suffering the individual endures.”

>“Capitalism did not defeat communism because capitalism was more ethical, because individual liberties are sacred or because God was angry with the heathen communists. Rather, capitalism won the Cold War because distributed data processing works better than centralised data processing, at least in periods of accelerating technological change. The central committee of the Communist Party just could not deal with the rapidly changing world of the late twentieth century. When all data is accumulated in one secret bunker, and all important decisions are taken by a group of elderly apparatchiks, they can produce nuclear bombs by the cartload, but not an Apple or a Wikipedia.”

<b id="f1">1)</b> I used to think he was a lazy guy. The quote is from <a href="https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol8-trans/176" target="_blank">this letter</a> written a week before he published correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations" target="_blank">field equations of GR or EFE</a>. At that point of time he was very afraid that GR will be formulated by someone before him. Indeed it happened as he feared and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity_priority_dispute#Undisputed_facts" target="_blank">Hilbert probably found the correct field equations</a> ( $R_{\mu \nu }-{\frac {1}{2}}Rg_{\mu \nu }={\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }$ the cosmological constant came later) independently 5 days before him. Even if Hilbert actually found the complete equations before him, he would still be the <b>single biggest contributor</b> to the formulation of GR because he found the equations without the trace term(i.e. $R_{\mu \nu }={\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }$) first and was aware that he should add some term to make both sides consistent since $\nabla_{\nu} T^{\mu \nu}=0$ but $\nabla_{\nu} R^{\mu \nu }\neq 0$. Also Hilbert fully credited Einstein as the originator of the theory and no public priority dispute concerning the field equations ever arose between the two men during their lives.<a href="#a1">↩</a>

<b id="f2">2)</b> This statement was made considering General Relativity, a classical theory. It was written in 1983 (9 years after Hawking radiation was predicted) in the preface of his book. Maybe he was unaware of the humongous number of states needed for a black hole to interpret Bekenstein-Hawking entropy statistically.<a href="#a2">↩</a>

<b id="f4">4)</b> He meant mathematicians should become part time physicists and help them otherwise they can't do it.<a href="#a4">↩</a>

<b id="f5">5)</b> He was not aware of Gödel's incompleteness theorems when saying this.<a href="#a5">↩</a>

<b id="f7">7)</b> Taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesamutti_Sutta" target="_blank">Kesamutti Sutta</a>. Often times some people people misinterpret this quote to portray Buddhism as a religion based on logic, even though Buddha stated that one should not determine the validity of a statement "by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought". When dealing with scientific theories logic should be given at most importance. But Buddha is not talking about scientific truths, he is talking about morality. Based on science and logic it is strongly evident that there is no such thing as free will. This doesn't mean we should forget about morality. We are in a stubbornly persistent illusion that we have free will and so we should always consider ourselves as responsible beings to be consistent with our illusion.<a href="#a7">↩</a>
