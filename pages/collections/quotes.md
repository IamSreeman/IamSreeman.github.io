### Physicists

>“I worked horribly strenuously, strange that one can endure that.”<sup id="a1"><a href="#f1">1</a></sup>

>“People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a **stubbornly persistent illusion.**”

>“I believe with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer" target="_blank">Schopenhauer</a>: ***We can do what we wish, but we can only wish what we must***. Practically, I am, nevertheless, compelled to act as if freedom of the will existed. If I wish to live in a civilized community, I must act as if man is a responsible being. I know that philosophically a murderer is not responsible for his crime; nevertheless, I must protect myself from unpleasant contacts. I may consider him guiltless, but I prefer not to take tea with him.”

>“It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. **I do not believe in a personal God** and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.”

>“I cannot imagine a God who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation, whose purposes are modelled after our own — a God, in short, who is but a reflection of human frailty. Neither can I believe that the individual survives the death of his body, although feeble souls harbour such thoughts through **fear or ridiculous egotisms**.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank">Albert Einstein</a>

>“Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler" target="_blank">John Archibald Wheeler</a>

>“If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature were not worth knowing, life would not be worth living.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9" target="_blank">Henri Poincaré</a>

>“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton" target="_blank">Isaac Newton</a>

>“Being myself a remarkably stupid fellow, I have had to unteach myself the difficulties, and now beg to present to my fellow fools the parts that are not hard. Master these thoroughly, and the rest will follow. ***What one fool can do, another can.***”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvanus_P._Thompson" target="_blank">Silvanus P. Thompson</a>

>“The black holes of nature are **the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe**: the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time. And since the general theory of Relativity provides only a single unique family of solutions for their descriptions, they are the simplest objects as well.”<sup id="a2"><a href="#f2">2</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subrahmanyan_Chandrasekhar" target="_blank">Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar</a>

>“Black holes ain't as black as they are painted. They are not the eternal prisons they were once thought. Things can get out of a black hole, both to the outside, and possibly to another universe. So if you feel you are in a black hole, don't give up. There's a way out.”

>“We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can **understand the Universe**. That makes us something very special.”

>“I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first ... I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking" target="_blank">Stephen Hawking</a>

>“I cannot understand why we idle discussing **religion**. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of **false assertions**, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why **primitive people**, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling.
>
>But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the **postulate** of an **Almighty God** helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit.
>
>Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of **all mortal sins**.”<sup id="a3"><a href="#f3">3</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac" target="_blank">P.A.M Dirac</a>


>“Religion is an insult to **human dignity**. Without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.But for good people to do evil things, that takes **religion**.”

>“I think the world needs to wake up from its long nightmare of religious belief; and anything that we scientists can do to ***weaken the hold of religion*** should be done, and may in fact be our greatest contribution to civilization.

>“I have a friend — or had a friend, now dead — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdus_Salam" target="_blank">Abdus Salam</a>, a very devout Muslim, who was trying to bring science into the universities in the Gulf states and he told me that he had a terrible time because, although they were very receptive to technology, they felt that science would be a corrosive to religious belief, and they were worried about it... and damn it, I think they were right. ***It is corrosive of religious belief, and it's a good thing too***.”

>“The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more **it also seems pointless**.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg" target="_blank">Steven Weinberg</a>

>“But he (Galileo) was not an idiot,... **Only an idiot could believe that scientific truth needs martyrdom** — that may be necessary in religion, but scientific results prove themselves in time.”

>“If I were to awaken after having slept for a thousand years, my first question would be: Has the Riemann hypothesis been proven?”

― <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David_Hilbert" target="_blank">David Hilbert</a>

>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana" target="_blank">Nirvana</a> is a state of pure blissful knowledge... It has nothing to do with the individual. The ego or its separation is an illusion. Indeed in a certain sense two "I"'s are identical namely when one disregards all special contents — their Karma. The goal of man is to preserve his Karma and to develop it further... when man dies his Karma lives and creates for itself another carrier.”

>“In itself, the insight is not new. The earliest records, to my knowledge, date back some 2500 years or more... the recognition **<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80tman_(Hinduism)" target="_blank">ATMAN</a> = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahman" target="_blank">BRAHMAN</a>** (the personal self equals the omnipresent, all-comprehending eternal self) was in Indian thought considered, far from being blasphemous, to represent the quintessence of deepest insight into the happenings of the world. The striving of all the scholars of Vedanta was after having learnt to pronounce with their lips, really assimilate in their minds this grandest of all thoughts.
>
>Again, the mystics of many centuries, independently, yet in perfect harmony with each other (somewhat like the particles in an ideal gas) have described, each of them, the unique experience of his or her life in terms that can be condensed in the phrase: DEUS FACTUS SUM (I have become God).To Western ideology, the thought has remained a stranger...”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Schr%C3%B6dinger" target="_blank">Erwin Schrödinger</a>


>“I was born not knowing and have had only a **little time** to change that here and there.”

>“From a long view of the history of mankind — seen from, say, ten thousand years from now — there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell's discovery of the laws of electrodynamics. The American Civil War will **pale** into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade.”

>“It doesn't seem to me that this fantastically marvellous universe, this tremendous range of time and space and different kinds of animals, and all the different planets, and all these atoms with all their motions, and so on, all this complicated thing can merely be a stage so that God can watch human beings struggle for good and evil — which is the view that religion has. The stage is too big for the drama.”

>“God was always invented to explain mystery. God is always invented to explain those things that you do not understand. Now when you finally discover how something works, you get some laws which you're taking away from God; you don't need him anymore. But you need him for the other mysteries. So therefore you leave him to create the universe because we haven't figured that out yet; you need him for understanding those things which you don't believe the laws will explain, such as consciousness, or why you only live to a certain length of time — life and death — stuff like that. God is always associated with those things that you do not understand. Therefore I don't think that the laws can be considered to be like God because they have been figured out.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman" target="_blank">Richard Feynman</a>

>“Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie" target="_blank">Marie Curie</a>


>“In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no overstatement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.”

>“If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electron remains the same, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether the electron's position changes with time, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether the electron is at rest, we must say 'no'; if we ask whether it is in motion, we must say 'no'. **The Buddha** has given such answers when interrogated as to the conditions of a man's self after his death; but they are not familiar answers for the tradition of seventeenth and eighteenth century science.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer" target="_blank">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a>

>“It is just as foolish to complain that people are selfish and treacherous as it is to complain that the magnetic field does not increase unless the electric field has a curl. Both are laws of nature.”

>“Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann" target="_blank">John von Neumann</a>

>“A possible explanation of the physicist's use of mathematics to formulate his laws of nature is that he is a somewhat irresponsible person. As a result, when he finds a connection between two quantities which resembles a connection well-known from mathematics, he will jump at the conclusion that the connection is that discussed in mathematics simply because he does not know of any other similar connection.”

>“The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither ***understand*** nor ***deserve***.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Wigner" target="_blank">Eugene Wigner</a>

>“Niels Bohr brain-washed a whole generation of physicists into believing that the problem had been solved fifty years ago [comment on the Copenhagen interpretation].”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann" target="_blank">Murray Gell-Mann</a>

>“The question of the origin of the matter in the universe is no longer thought to be beyond the range of science — everything can be created from nothing…it is fair to say that the universe is the ultimate free lunch.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Guth" target="_blank">Alan Guth</a>

>“Science flies you to the moon. Religion flies you into buildings.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_J._Stenger" target="_blank">Victor J. Stenger</a>

![alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/images/posts/pbdot.jpeg "Pale blue dot")
>“Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of **confident religions**, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
>
>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a **fraction of a dot**.
>
>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
>
>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.
>
>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores ***our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot***, the only home we've ever known.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan" target="_blank">Carl Sagan</a>
### Philosophers

>“**Desires** are the root cause of **sadness**.”<sup id="a4"><a href="#f4">4</a></sup>

>“How then can it be compassionate to gorge on other beings’ blood and flesh? Monks who will not wear silks from the East, whether coarse or fine; who will not wear shoes or boots of leather, nor furs, nor birds’ down from our own country; and who will not consume milk, curds, or ghee, have truly freed themselves from the world.”

>“Now, Kalamas,<br>
Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing (anussava),<br>
nor upon tradition (paramparā),<br>
nor upon rumor (itikirā),<br>
nor upon what is in a scripture (piṭaka-sampadāna),<br>
nor upon surmise (takka-hetu),<br>
nor upon an axiom (naya-hetu),<br>
nor upon specious reasoning (ākāra-parivitakka),<br>
nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over (diṭṭhi-nijjhān-akkh-antiyā),<br>
nor upon another's seeming ability (bhabba-rūpatāya),<br>
nor upon the consideration, The monk is our teacher (samaṇo no garū).<br>
Kalamas, when you yourselves know: "These things are good; these things are not blamable; these things are praised by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to benefit and happiness," enter on and abide in them.”<sup id="a5"><a href="#f5">5</a></sup>

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha" target="_blank">Gautama Buddha</a> (I do not support main stream ***unscientific*** Buddhism. You can read my views on religion <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/2020/05/views-on-religion.html" target="_blank">here</a>.)

>“Skepticism, while logically impeccable, is psychologically impossible, and there is an element of frivolous insincerity in any philosophy which pretends to accept it.”

>“If there were a God, I think it very unlikely that he would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt his existence.”

>“I think all the great religions of the world - Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, and Communism - both untrue and harmful. It is evident as a matter of logic that, since they disagree, not more than one of them can be true. With very few exception, the religions which a man accepts is that of the community in which he lives, which makes it obvious that the influence of environment is what has led him to accept the religion in question.”

>“If everything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If there can be anything without a cause, it may just as well be the world as God, so that there cannot be any validity in that argument. It is exactly of the same nature as the Hindu's view, that the world rested upon an elephant and the elephant rested upon a tortoise; and when they said, "How about the tortoise?" the Indian said, "Suppose we change the subject." The argument is really no better than that.”

>“In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge the governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%E2%80%93Einstein_Manifesto" target="_blank">Russell–Einstein Manifesto</a>)

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" target="_blank">Bertrand Russell</a>

>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus" target="_blank">Epicurus</a>’s old questions are yet unanswered. Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?”

>“Ignorance is the mother of Devotion.”

>“Survey most nations and most ages. Examine the religious principles, which have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You will scarcely be persuaded, that they are any thing but sick men's dreams: Or perhaps will regard them more as the playsome whimsies of monkies in human shape, than the serious, positive, dogmatical asseverations of a being, who dignifies himself with the name of rational.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume" target="_blank">David Hume</a>

>“In order to seek truth, it is necessary once in the course of our life, to doubt, as far as possible, of all things.”

>“I shall then suppose . . . some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon" target="_blank">evil genius</a> not less powerful than deceitful, has employed his whole energies in deceiving me; I shall consider that . . . all . . . external things are but illusions and dreams of which this genius has availed himself to lay traps for my credulity.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes" target="_blank">René Descartes</a>

>“He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself does not become a monster. **And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you**.”

>“I cannot believe in a God who wants to be praised all the time.”

>“The modern scientific counterpart to belief in God is the belief in the universe as an organism: this disgusts me. This is to make what is quite rare and extremely derivative, the organic, which we perceive only on the surface of the earth, into something essential, universal, and eternal! This is still an anthropomorphizing of nature!”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" target="_blank">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>

>“Is the pious being loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is being loved by the gods?”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates" target="_blank">Socrates</a>

>“Religion is too important a matter to its devotees to be a subject of ridicule. If they indulge in absurdities, they are to be pitied rather than ridiculed.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" target="_blank">Immanuel Kant</a>

>“The philosopher has never killed any priests, whereas the priest has killed a great many philosophers.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Diderot" target="_blank">Denis Diderot</a>
### Others

>“Napoleon, and other great men of his type, they were makers of empire. But there is an order of men that get beyond that: They are not makers of empire, but they are makers of universe. And when they have made those universes, their hands are unstained by the blood of any human being on earth. ... Ptolemy made a universe, which lasted 1400 years. Newton also made a universe, which has lasted 300 years. Einstein has made a universe, and I can't tell you how long that will last.”

>“The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality of happiness, and by no means a necessity of life.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw" target="_blank">George Bernard Shaw</a>

>“However statistically improbable the entity you seek to explain by invoking a designer, the designer himself has got to be at least as improbable. God is the [Ultimate Boeing 747](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Boeing_747_gambit).”

>“The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins" target="_blank">Richard Dawkins</a>

>“If there is a God, atheism must strike Him as less of an insult than religion.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond_de_Goncourt" target="_blank">Edmond de Goncourt</a>

>“If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" target="_blank">Isaac Asimov</a>

>Asking, 'If there is no God, what is the purpose of life?' is like asking, 'If there is no master, whose slave will I be?' If your purpose of life is to submit as a slave, then your meaning comes from flattering the ego of a person whom you should detest.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Barker" target="_blank">Dan Barker</a>

>“In some ways people had got used to the idea that India was spiritual and religion-oriented. That gave a leg up to the religious interpretation of India, despite the fact that Sanskrit had a larger atheistic literature than exists in any other classical language. Madhava Acharya, the remarkable 14th century philosopher, wrote this rather great book called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vidyaranya#Sarvadar%C5%9Banasa%E1%B9%85graha" target="_blank">Sarvadarśanasaṅgraha</a>, which discussed all the religious schools of thought within the Hindu structure. The first chapter is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charvaka" target="_blank">Cārvāka</a>" or "Atheism"—a very strong presentation of the argument in favor of atheism and materialism.”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen" target="_blank">Amartya Sen</a>

>“Doubts about the existence of free will and individuals are nothing new, of course. More than 2,000 years ago thinkers in India, China and Greece argued that ‘the individual self is an illusion’. Yet such doubts don’t really change history much unless they have a practical impact on economics, politics and day-to-day life. Humans are masters of cognitive dissonance, and we allow ourselves to believe one thing in the laboratory and an altogether different thing in the courthouse or in parliament. Just as Christianity didn’t disappear the day Darwin published On the Origin of Species, so liberalism won’t vanish just because scientists have reached the conclusion that there are no free individuals.”

>“Buddha agreed with modern biology and New Age movements that happiness is independent of external conditions. Yet his more important and far more profound insight was that true happiness is also independent of our inner feelings. Indeed, the more significance we give our feelings, the more we crave them, and the more we suffer. Buddha’s recommendation was to stop not only the pursuit of external achievements, but also the pursuit of inner feelings.”

>“Understanding human history in the millennia following the Agricultural Revolution boils down to a single question: how did humans organise themselves in mass-cooperation networks, when they lacked the biological instincts necessary to sustain such networks? The short answer is that humans created imagined orders and devised scripts. These two inventions filled the gaps left by our biological inheritance.”

>“How do you cause people to believe in an imagined order such as Christianity, democracy or capitalism? First, you never admit that the order is imagined.”

>“So, monotheism explains order, but is mystified by evil. Dualism explains evil, but is puzzled by order. There is one logical way of solving the riddle: to argue that there is a single omnipotent God who created the entire universe – and He's ***evil***. But nobody in history has had the stomach for such a belief.”

>“Today more than ninety per cent of all large animals are domesticated. Consider the chicken, for example. Ten thousand years ago it was a rare bird confined to small niches of South Asia. Today billions of chickens live on almost every continent and island, bar Antarctica. The domesticated chicken is probably the most widespread bird in the annals of planet Earth. If you measure success in terms of numbers, chickens, cows and pigs are the most successful animals ever. Alas, domesticated species paid for their unparalleled collective success with unprecedented individual suffering.”

>“Yet from the viewpoint of the herd, rather than that of the shepherd, it’s hard to avoid the impression that for the vast majority of domesticated animals, the Agricultural Revolution was a terrible catastrophe. Their evolutionary ‘success’ is meaningless. A rare wild rhinoceros on the brink of extinction is probably more satisfied than a calf who spends its short life inside a tiny box, fattened to produce juicy steaks. The contented rhinoceros is no less content for being among the last of its kind. The numerical success of the calf’s species is little consolation for the suffering the individual endures.”

>“Capitalism did not defeat communism because capitalism was more ethical, because individual liberties are sacred or because God was angry with the heathen communists. Rather, capitalism won the Cold War because distributed data processing works better than centralised data processing, at least in periods of accelerating technological change. The central committee of the Communist Party just could not deal with the rapidly changing world of the late twentieth century. When all data is accumulated in one secret bunker, and all important decisions are taken by a group of elderly apparatchiks, they can produce nuclear bombs by the cartload, but not an Apple or a Wikipedia.”

>“I am crying. I'm not sad that I'm dying. I am finally sad that my child died. You can’t just erase people’s feelings. It’s as if my emotions just wandered around in an unknown place somewhere hundreds of miles away. It’s as if they were sent long ago, in a letter that was always intended for me. **So this is what true sadness feels like. It feels a lot like...happiness**.”

>“And there you go. You heard her, Iri. <a href="https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Artoria_Pendragon_(Saber)" target="_blank">Our Heroic Spirit</a> thinks a battlefield to be something better than Hell. What a joke. It’s Hell itself. There is no hope on a battlefield. There is nothing but unspeakable despair. Just a crime we call victory, paid for by the pain of the defeated. But humanity has never recognized this truth. And the reason is that, in every era, a dazzling hero has blinded the people with their legends, and kept them from seeing the evil of bloodshed. True human nature has not advanced a step beyond the Stone Age.”

<b id="f1">1)</b> I used to think he was a lazy guy. The quote is from <a href="https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol8-trans/176" target="_blank">this letter</a> written a week before he published correct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations" target="_blank">field equations of GR or EFE</a>. At that point of time he was very afraid that GR will be formulated by someone before him. Indeed it happened as he feared and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity_priority_dispute#Undisputed_facts" target="_blank">Hilbert probably found the correct field equations</a> ( $R_{\mu \nu }-{\frac {1}{2}}Rg_{\mu \nu }={\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }$ the cosmological constant came later) independently 5 days before him. Even if Hilbert actually found the complete equations before him, he would still be the <b>single biggest contributor</b> to the formulation of GR because he found the equations without the trace term(i.e. $R_{\mu \nu }={\frac{8\pi G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }$) first and was aware that he should add some term to make both sides consistent since $\nabla_{\nu} T_{\mu \nu }=0$ but $\nabla_{\nu} R_{\mu \nu }\neq 0$.<a href="#a1">↩</a>

<b id="f2">2)</b> This statement was made considering General Relativity, a classical theory. It was written in 1983 (9 years after Hawking radiation was predicted) in the preface of his book. Maybe he was unaware of the humongous number of states needed for a black hole to interpret Bekenstein-Hawking entropy statistically.<a href="#a2">↩</a>

<b id="f4">4)</b> It is second of the Four Noble Truths mentioned in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhammacakkappavattana_Sutta" target="_blank">Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</a>.<a href="#a4">↩</a>

<b id="f5">5)</b> Taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kesamutti_Sutta" target="_blank">Kesamutti Sutta</a>. Often times some people people misinterpret this quote to portray Buddhism as a religion based on logic, even though Buddha stated that one should not determine the validity of a statement "by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought". When dealing with scientific theories logic should be given at most importance. But Buddha is not talking about scientific truths, he is talking about morality. Based on science and logic it is strongly evident that there is no such thing as free will. This doesn't mean we should forget about morality. We are in a stubbornly persistent illusion that we have free will and so we should always consider ourselves as responsible beings to be consistent with our illusion.<a href="#a5">↩</a>
