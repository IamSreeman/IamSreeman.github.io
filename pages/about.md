My name is **Kasireddy Sreeman Reddy**[^name] and I'm a physics PhD student (2024-2029) at the Weizmann Institute in the <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/particle/High_Energy_Physics/" target="_blank">hep-th group</a> advised by Prof. Aharony and Prof. Berkooz. Previously I did my undergrad in physics at <a href="https://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/en/undergraduate" target="_blank">IIT Bombay</a> (2019-2023) with Honors in physics and masters at <a href="https://www.brandeis.edu/physics/" target="_blank">Brandeis University</a> (2023-2024).

I am currently interested in doing research in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity" target="_blank">quantum gravity</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory" target="_blank">string theory</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle" target="_blank">holography</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory" target="_blank">quantum field theories</a> (especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_field_theory" target="_blank">CFTs</a>), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology" target="_blank">cosmology</a>.

##### Hobbies:
1. Questioning <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/philosophy/">my current philosophical beliefs</a>. Thinking about some metaphysical and ethical questions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_there_is_anything_at_all" target="_blank">Why there is anything at all?</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life" target="_blank">What is the meaning of life?</a> etc.<br>
1. Reading the history of physics.<br>
1. Watching <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/anime/">anime</a> and reading manga.<br>
1. Being in a stubbornly persistent illusion that I have free will.<br>
<!-- 1. Waking people from their deep dogmatic slumber.<br>-->
1. Adding extra firm tofu to everything I cook.

[^name]:
    In Telugu script: కసిరెడ్డి శ్రీమాన్ రెడ్డి, in Devanagari: कसिरेड्डि श्रीमान रेड्डि and in International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA): /kasiɾeɖɖi ʃɾiːmaːn ɾeɖɖi/.

    In this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telugu_names" target="_blank">Telugu name</a> *Sreeman* is the given name and *Kasireddy* is the family name and Telugu family names come at the beginning of the name (unlike any other Indian culture) and are almost always abbreviated.

    ||Actual name| Legal name (typo)|
    |---|---|---|
    |State or Country| Kasireddy Sreeman Reddy | Kasi Reddy Sreeman Reddy|
    |International| Sreeman Reddy Kasireddy | Sreeman Reddy Kasi Reddy |

    In all Indian and Andhra Pradesh official documents, there is a wrong space and my name is written as *Kasi Reddy Sreeman Reddy*, and I am continuing that mistake in all official documents. For official international documents I am using *Sreeman Reddy Kasi Reddy* as my name.

    Unfortunately, my name contains my former caste "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddy" target="_blank">Reddy</a>" twice. But ever since I stopped believing in Hinduism at age 10 or 11, I do not identify with any caste. I am strongly against all forms of hierarchical discrimination, from casteism to speciesism, as explained in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/philosophy/#fn:Sentient">this page at footnote 2</a>. 

[^theories]:
    From an empirical view point QFT (or more precisely the standard model which is a theory, but QFT itself is a framework) has much more predictive and explanatory power compared to general relativity. But the standard model requires 25 fundamental dimensionless constants which must come from experiments. General relativity needs no fundamental dimensionless constants and in principle (even in practice that was how it was discovered) can be completely guessed if one knows Newton's gravity and electromagnetism and is more elegant than QFT. General relativity has uniqueness that is not present in the standard model. Like GR, string theory is also a very unique theory. String theory has ***only 1 fundamental dimensionless constant*** the string length in the Planck units (the string coupling constant is itself not a fundamental dimensionless constant because it is dynamical and is related to the dilaton also in the limit of large string coupling it becomes a new dimension of the M-theory).<br><br>
    QM is lower than classical physics because when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#Comparisons" target="_blank">comparing</a> between the dozen+ interpretations there is no proper answer to basic questions like whether reality is probabilistic or deterministic. This problem is less severe in QFT/string theory because they put more constraints on interpretations. For example, de Broglie–Bohm interpretation is equally good as others for QM but it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory#Relativity" target="_blank">doesn't work well</a> with special relativity.
