Hi, my name is **Kasi Reddy Sreeman Reddy** and I'm an undergraduate studying   <a href="http://www.phy.iitb.ac.in/" target="_blank">B. Tech in Engineering physics at IIT Bombay</a>. I am also pursuing a minor in <a href="http://www.math.iitb.ac.in/" target="_blank">Mathematics</a> and honours in Physics. I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadipatri" target="_blank">Tadipatri,  Andhra Pradesh.</a><br>
I am more interested in fundamental theoretical physics (like Quantum Gravity theories, Cosmology etc.) compared to Applied Physics or Experimental physics.
##### Hobbies:
1) Reading physics books and history of physics.<br>
2) Watching Anime.<br>
3) Thinking about some metaphysical questions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_there_is_anything_at_all" target="_blank">Why there is anything at all?</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_of_life" target="_blank">What is the meaning of life?</a> etc.<br>

Recently I started writing on Physics Stack Exchange.
