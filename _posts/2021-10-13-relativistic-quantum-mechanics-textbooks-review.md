In this post, I will review some textbooks on relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM). Most quantum field theory (QFT) books will discuss *some* RQM in the beginning and why it is not a correct theory and will move on to QFT. Here I will only review those which discuss RQM *somewhat* completely.<!--more--> RQM is a  one-particle theory.<br>

## Best introductory books
1) Wachter, Armin (2011). *Relativistic Quantum Mechanics*. Theoretical and Mathematical Physics series. Springer.

This book is organised into 3 chapters with the 1st on spin 0 particles, the 2nd one on spin 1/2 particles and the 3rd one on scattering theory. It is organised very neatly. 

2) Greiner, Walter (2000). *Relativistic Quantum Mechanics. Wave Equations* (3rd ed.). Springer.

Greiner has written many books on QM and QFTs. This book is a bridge between his QM and QFT books. Unlike the above book it discusses spins higher than 1/2 also. But for spin 0 and spin 1/2 it discusses slightly less completely than the above book.

## Best advanced books
1) Volodimir Simulik (2020). *Relativistic Quantum Mechanics and Field Theory of Arbitrary Spin*. Nova Science Publishers.

It discusses higher spin RQM and also QFT. This is a rigorous book. It also presents 26 different derivations of the Dirac equation.

There are other QFT books that also discuss RQM at the beginning like Gauge theories in particle physics by Aitchison and Hey (Vol 1 chapter 3), Lectures on Quantum Field Theory by Ashok Das (up to chapter 4) , Quantum Field Theory by Lewis Ryder (chapter 2), etc.
