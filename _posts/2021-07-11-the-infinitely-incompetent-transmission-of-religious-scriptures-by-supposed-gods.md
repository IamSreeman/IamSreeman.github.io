Assuming that the gods of monotheism and polytheism are competent, I will argue that they do not exist. Unlike the [problem of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Logical_problem_of_evil){:target="_blank"}, which only works for [Abrahamic religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic_religions){:target="_blank"}, this will work for all theistic religions, including Hinduism. This argument doesn't work against Supernatural Atheism, especially the subset of Supernatural Atheism that is called "nontheistic religions", which includes Buddhism and Jainism.

## Introduction

The problem of evil is a very powerful argument against monotheism. Abrahamic theologians' least absurd solution for this is Plantinga’s free will defense. But there are many [natural evils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil#Natural_evil){:target="_blank"}, like tornados, floods, etc, that are not caused by any person's free will. Plantinga claims that even these are caused by Satan's free will. It is very absurd to make such *ad hoc* claims with no evidence. How does he even know that all the natural suffering is actually secretly done by Satan when it's not even mentioned in their scriptures? Also why a god respects the free will of Satan more than all the natural suffering endured by sentient beings remains unanswered.

But the problem of evil fails for religions like Hinduism. You might have seen victim blaming in Abrahamic religions like in the [original sin](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Original_sin){:target="_blank"}. What Adam and Eve did is not even an evil thing. But somehow, this malevolent God is punishing all future humans for what those 2 did. Apparently, by default, every human will go to hell because of this, and unless you believe in this God, in which case he/she/it will forgive you. So, he/she/it will send even morally perfect people who didn't believe in his/her/its existence to hell and tortures eternally for the mere reason of not believing his/her/its existence but will accept to heaven anyone who believes in his/her/its existence for irrational reasons like childhood indoctrination, circular arguments, blind faith etc even if they are the most immoral person. In this case, blaming the people who go to hell instead of the unjust God is victim blaming.

Imagine in the far future, I become a galactic dictator & by using mind uploading + [Intelligence Amplification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification){:target="_blank"}, I become a very advanced being & do mass surveillance on every sapient being (humans & other aliens that can do abstract thinking). Instead of actually helping the galactic citizens, I try to hide myself and control everything secretly like the [Illuminati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_conspiracy_theory#Illuminati){:target="_blank"} & meticulously make sure there is 0 evidence of my existence except I meet a few people in a small corner of the galaxy and prove to them that I am in fact real & I do control the entire galactic government secretly & I tell them many rules they need to follow especially about the objectively most fundamental matter in the entire universe which is what sapient beings do with their genitals. I tell them to tell the others. Then these few people have tried to tell others for centuries, but many still have never heard it. Just like in the real world, most people in India and China (together, more than 1/3 of the humans) never know much about the Christian bible. During the census every year, everyone is asked what religion they believe in & I note down those who believe in my existence. When anyone dies in the galaxy, I [copy their minds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading){:target="_blank"} without consent & then there comes the judgment day, where I finally decide to show up & resurrect every sapient being by copying their code into artificial biological bodies. I see in the census what their religion is in the last year of their life, & if they didn't believe in my existence, then I just send them to one side of the galaxy where they will be forever tortured & I keep replacing any part of their bodies that is damaged. The others who actually believed & had faith in me despite negligible evidence are declared as Good no matter how many people they raped or even if that person is a Galactic Hitler that killed trillions of sentient beings. I send these resurrected people to the side of the galaxy where they can always be happy. Then do you consider me an omnibenevolent, i.e., an infinite compassionate being? And if you still think the Abrahamic god is a good man, [I have a bridge](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/I_have_a_bridge_to_sell_you){:target="_blank"} the size of [Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules%E2%80%93Corona_Borealis_Great_Wall){:target="_blank"} to sell you.

Hinduism is several orders of magnitude more comfortable with victim blaming than Abrahamic religions. If some evil happens, then one can always blame the victim by saying in the past life he/she was evil, and so this is all [Karma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma){:target="_blank"}. The fact that the number of human souls is constantly increasing is not an argument against Hinduism because Hindus think the souls of animals are also similar to humans, and those few Hindus who thought might have concluded that the total number of sentient animal souls is conserved. It is generally said that those who did good things as animals in the past life will be promoted to humans, and those who did bad things will be demoted to lower castes or lower animals on the biological ladder. Trillions ([1](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/wild-caught-fish){:target="_blank"},[2](https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/shrimp-the-animals-most-commonly-used-and-killed-for-food-production){:target="_blank"},[3](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/farmed-crustaceans){:target="_blank"},[4](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/farmed-fish-killed){:target="_blank"}) of sentient animals are needlessly tortured and killed every year in animal agriculture. To a Hindu, why are supposedly good gods not stopping this atrocity is a simple question because they think it is justice to allow those people/animals who did immoral things in the past life to suffer.

In this post, I will discuss an argument that works for all theistic religions: Assuming the fictional gods have as many powers as they claim, such as omnipotence, then they are immeasurably/infinitely incompetent.

**Note**: [A True Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_True_Story){:target="_blank"}, written by a Syrian author in 200 AD, is the first "fictional" story in human history. The start of the book explains that it is all "lies". Before 200 AD the concept of fiction was not known to most humans. So, except Islam, all the famous religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity) came before the concept of fiction. Most of the Hindu mythology supposedly "happened" tens of thousands of years before they were written. It's probably written by fools who wanted to write fiction but couldn't comprehend the concept of fiction. The characters mentioned in Hindu mythology supposedly "existed" tens of thousands of years before the earliest recorded person, [Kushim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushim_(Uruk_period)){:target="_blank"}.

## The argument

**P1**: If a God exists, he/she/it will be competent at things that he/she/it wants to do & sending the Holy Information reliably is something he/she/it wants to do.<br>
**P2**: In all theistic religions, the Gods are very incompetent at sharing the Holy Information (that they regard as important) in a way that makes sure it reaches every person and compels at least all rational people to believe in it.<br>
**C1**: Therefore, these Gods are fictional, and the incompetency in sending this information is completely human in nature. Some ordinary humans created these religions, but they were incompetent in sending this information to all humans.

I assume all theists will agree with Premise 1. I will justify Premise 2 separately for [Hinduism](#hinduism){:target="_blank"} and [Abrahamic religions](#abrahamic-religions){:target="_blank"}. This argument will similarly work for all theistic religions like Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, etc.

## Example of a competent transmission

I will give 2 examples of how I would transmit important information if I had 1) Advanced science & technology and 2) Omnipotence. Both of these examples are much better than what popular (fictional) gods used.

1) Advanced science & technology:
- For comparison with gods, we should at least consider someone as powerful as a benevolent dictator of the world government. Since a unified world government doesn't need a military, we can drastically reduce the world military expenditure and instead use that to build a gigantic particle accelerator and experimentally verify a quantum gravity theory. Then the world government's benevolent dictator can send everyone on this planet this important information by mandating every social media app like YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter to share it on the homepage and ask everyone to teach this to their children. This way this important information is transmitted to everyone.
- For an even more advanced civilization that has built things like [Dyson sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere){:target="_blank"}, energy will be quite abundant. So, the benevolent world dictator can create billions of robots such that everyone gets a robot to help with all daily needs. This robot should also tell them whatever important info that their benevolent world dictator wants them to know by projecting it on a wall. The analog of this for a god would be sending a "holy animated video" to every robot that contains all the commandments etc.

2) Omnipotence: For an omnipotent being it will be quite easy to create a copy of himself for every sentient being and always roam with every sentient being and transmit to everyone all the important information. Each being's version is visible to only them. You can even give them infinite regeneration abilities and infinite cognitive abilities and make sure they will never suffer again. For example, if you try to kill someone then your version of god will stop it and peacefully explain to you that everyone is immortal and you can't do this stuff anymore and will tell you to be more peaceful. This method solves many other issues with theism apart from solving God's incompetency in sending his messages it also solves [divine hiddeness](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/divine-hiddenness/){:target="_blank"}, the problem of evil, etc. People can verify with each other that their version of god also told the same moral rules.

## Hinduism

It doesn't matter how many times and how many Hindus repeat that ancient Indians had nuclear bombs, airplanes, internet, etc [Sources: [1](https://www.science.org/content/article/hindu-nationalists-claim-ancient-indians-had-airplanes-stem-cell-technology-and){:target="_blank"}, [2](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ancient-india-aeroplanes-nuclear-weapons-chief-history-chairman-indian-council-historical-research-228149-2014-11-21){:target="_blank"}]. No amount of chest-thumping ethnocentrism and superiority complex will make these ridiculous things true history. It is a matter of fact that we Indians are one of the last civilizations to get scripture and there is no shame in accepting it for a rational person. Different things came to different civilizations at different times; for example, [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Arabic_numeral_system){:target="_blank"} were first properly understood by Indians, and then it took centuries for them to go to the Middle East, and it took a millennium to go to Europeans. Most Europeans don't deny this history and make false pseudohistory just because they learned numbers 1000+ years after Indians discovered it & were using the stupid Roman numerals even after 1000 years after Indians discovered proper numbers. Getting script late means Indian history is less reliable than other places. See this [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_first_written_account){:target="_blank"}. Egyptians had scripture in 2690 BC. Sumerians had in 2600 BC. Old Chinese script came in 1250 BC. Hebrew scripture came in 10th century BC. Old Arabic in 8th century BC. Latin in 7th century BC. Old Persian in 500 BC. And finally, in 260 BC, Ashokan Prakrit was there, which is the oldest discovered Indian sculpture. [Edicts of Ashoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edicts_of_Ashoka){:target="_blank"} are the oldest known written Indian script. Of course, the creation of Vedas started in 1500 BCE, so there was language already, but things like Vedas were orally transmitted for 1000+ years, during which it was changing frequently every century. Just to show how unreliable Indian history is, let me remind you that Ashoka was forgotten for more than 2000 years before some Britishers found these, even though he ruled most of the subcontinent. Just imagine that you ruled 90% of the Indian subcontinent (South Asia), which contained 33% of the world's population back then, and still everyone forgot your name. He was the most important Indian back then and even he was forgotten. So, every time religious scripture mentions someone who lived in that time who met with gods or who did some magic tricks, remember that they did not exist, and it's purely fiction.

Until this time (260 BC), scriptures were orally passed on for many generations. Even after the introduction of scripture, routinely, these scriptures were changed for a few centuries. One can only imagine how many changes were made by the time scripture came. So, how can we believe that these scriptures were not corrupted by many humans?

According to [Bg. 4.1](https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/4/1/){:target="_blank"}, Bhagavad Gita was originally spoken to the first man Manu. But as it is forgotten, it is again spoken to Arjuna by Kṛṣṇa 120,400,000 years after the previous time. Why are these gods not talented enough to send the message a single time and make sure that it reaches everyone in the first attempt itself instead of coming every few million years once?

A Hindu might claim that because this is [Kali Yuga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kali_Yuga){:target="_blank"}, we don't see gods often among humans but in previous yugas, they were not so secret and used to roam among people. But this is again not a rationally justifiable claim because we have a lot of evidence for example that dinosaurs existed but according to Hinduism there were also Hindus and Hindu gods roaming around that time but we have no evidence for that.

In many Hindu myths, important announcements by gods will be done by [Akashvani](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/akashvani){:target="_blank"} in Sanskrit which will be heard by all people in a very big region like a city. Even this is not a good way of communicating with humans. It should be said such that everyone hears in their own mother tongue and it should be audible to everyone in the world instead of a city. This way historians can cross-check different cultures and verify that it is indeed a miracle that all people heard the same thing in different languages and then it might seem more likely that a supernatural entity is behind this message.

**Geography**: Why is this supposedly important information only sent to people on our subcontinent? Why not to other places like the American continents, Africa, Europe, China, Arabia, etc?

## Abrahamic religions

**Geography**: Why is this supposedly important information only sent to people in the [Levant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant){:target="_blank"} region? Why not to other places like India, the American continents, Africa, Europe, China, Arabia, etc? God sent prophets just to a tiny part of Earth with messages/commandments that he wanted everyone on Earth to follow. This is easily explained within atheism, the people of that region created stories so of course, an ethocentric superiority complex is bound to be there and they of course would expect that the creator of the universe has a special priority for their ethnicity.

Even the way he revealed to such a tiny place was very incompetent. The books claimed to be his message sent by him via the so-called prophets were never written during the life spans of these prophets. These prophets had literally one job to make sure humans get this information right and yet they failed to do this one task. This gave to rise the routine claim that an old Abrahamic religion is updated by another one. For example, Christianity claims to be an update of Judaism, Islam claims to be an update of Christianity and Ahmadiyya claims to be an update of Islam. I expect an omnipotent being to be competent enough to just send a single concrete message instead of sending different messages and having to update frequently.

You might say some of the listed have only a few thousand people, so these are cults, not religions. But to me, all religions look like cults; just because a billion people believe in it doesn't make it any more true or legitimate; see the [Appeal to Popularity fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Appeal-to-Popularity){:target="_blank"}.

>“The Taiping Rebellion is the perfect example of the old adage that the **winners write the history books**. Most writers treat the Taipings as **poor deluded peasants following a madman's hallucinations**, but when you get right down to it, **that's how most religions begin** (not your religion obviously, but all the other ones). The only difference between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Xiuquan" target="_blank">Hong Xiuquan</a> and history's successful prophets is that if a professor, novelist, or cartoonist disrespects Hong Xiuquan, angry mobs won't call for his head.
>
>**Is fear of its followers really the best test of a religion's authenticity?** I'll admit that's the standard I use, but it's probably a good idea to remember that if the Taipings had won their rebellion, they might today be considered totally legit and every bit as Christian as the Mormons ("mostly, sort of").”

― <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Big_Book_of_Horrible_Things" target="_blank">Matthew White</a>

Also, he should have sent the message to many people at once like [Akashvani](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/akashvani){:target="_blank"} in Hinduism because a single prophet can manipulate and change God's message. If there are more people there will be less scope for such manipulation.

Even though science and technology have helped the Abrahamic god to more readily share his message via online websites of the bible etc, it is still true that billions of people on this planet do not know about his message. My own parents and grandparents know very little if anything about the Abrahamic god. So, despite the help from science and technology even now he is not competent to share this information with everyone in this world.

Also, there are some weird things like Aisha saying 2 verses on her bed were later, after the death of Muhammad, eaten by sheep ([Sunan Ibn Majah 1944](https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah:1944){:target="_blank"}), and God chose to never reveal these 2 verses again.

>“The Muslim community was not wealthy enough to stockpile animal skins for decades, and to produce a complete Mushaf, or copy, of the Holy Qur’an required a great many of them. The carbon dating evidence, then, indicates that Birmingham's Cadbury Research Library is home to [some precious survivors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Quran_manuscript){:target="_blank"} that – in view of the Suras included – would once have been at the centre of a Mushaf from that period. And it seems to leave open the possibility that the Uthmanic redaction took place earlier than had been thought – or even, conceivably, that these folios predate that process. In any case, this – along with the sheer beauty of the content and the surprisingly clear Hijazi script – is news to rejoice Muslim hearts.”

― <a href="https://themaydan.com/bio/muhammad-isa-waley/" target="_blank">Muhammad Isa Waley</a>

There is a strange irony in saying that the God who created the entire universe couldn't give paper to his messenger to write what he was telling & they couldn't even afford enough animal skins to write it fully until decades after his messenger's death. God of the entire universe couldn't give them a better method than the cruel method of murdering an animal & stealing its skin. It's not even that long ago, as by that time, China had been making a lot of paper for more than 500 years. God didn't even need to come with the discovery of paper; he merely needed to tell them to go to China & get it. Also around the same time, many different codices of the Quran, like the [Codex of Ubayy ibn Ka'b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_of_Ubayy_ibn_Ka%27b){:target="_blank"}, the [Codex of Ibn Mas'ud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_of_Ibn_Mas%27ud){:target="_blank"}, and the [Codex of Ali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushaf_of_Ali){:target="_blank"}, were written, but Uthman burnt all except his [Uthmanic codex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uthmanic_codex){:target="_blank"}, making the Quran an unreliable transmission that was not preserved perfectly.

Similarly, the original Old Testament [Urtext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urtext_(biblical_studies)){:target="_blank"} and the New Testament [Q source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_source){:target="_blank"} are both lost. We know almost nothing about what Jesus taught his cult. The only [two events that are certain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus){:target="_blank"} (i.e., there is consensus) about Yeshua of Nazareth are that he was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by order of the Roman Prefect [Pontius Pilate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontius_Pilate){:target="_blank"}. Instead of rationally accepting that their scripture was written centuries after Jesus died & has no relation to what the historical cult leader preached, many Christians ad hocly claim that for centuries, until it was written down, the Holy Spirit somehow preserved the bible despite the unreliable oral transmission across countries and languages.

Some think the explanation to why God sent the holy information in an unreliable way is not because he was incompetant but because even in cases (like Satan to whom he talked and also like those who saw Jesus miracles in [Mark chapter 3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%203&version=NIV){:target="_blank"} who belived he was possesed by demons) & told the information in reliable way they still didn't "believe" in him. So apparently, he doesn't care about sending it reliably because he only wants to see who will have blind "faith" rather than those who are rational. But Satan within the Abrahamic fictional verse saw & talked to God, so he ***definitely*** "believed" in the existence of God, even though he might not have "believed" that this God is worth worshiping/following. I am only considering the former version of belief. Whether God exists is an objective question, but whether he deserves to be worshipped is a subjective question that depends more on other things, like whether the person can ethically respect a God who genocided many groups, etc. Satan or the people in Mark chapter 3 (all these are fictional characters) definitely got the message in a reliable way that we did not.

## Nontheistic religions
Buddhism and Jainism consider the gods of Hinduism as mere people with supernatural abilities. Buddhists still think these Hindu deities need nirvana, and until then, they are also slaves to their desires. Even these deities' final goal should be to escape from the cycle of rebirth and death. If we ***define*** religion as a pseudoscientific, non-empirically verifiable claim about the afterlife, then indeed Buddhism and Jainism are religions even though they are not theistic religions.

In these religions, people like [Siddhārtha Gautama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha){:target="_blank"}, [Mahāvīra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavira){:target="_blank"}, etc are not considered gods. The message of Siddhārtha is very different from the message of the Abrahamic god. The Abrahamic god will torture anyone who doesn't believe in his message for infinite time, and yet he irresponsibly sent this message in an infinitely incompetent way. The message of Siddhārtha was a method for people to escape the cycle of rebirth and suffering & going to temporary heaven & temporary hell is partially dependent on prayers & mostly depends on your good karma. Siddhārtha didn't claim to be an omnipotent being, so his inability to share this information in a way that everyone on earth can find it is not his mistake.

So, my argument doesn't fully (I think it does partially work for even these because [Siddhārtha Gautama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha){:target="_blank"} and [Mahāvīra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavira){:target="_blank"} were supposed to have many miraculous powers & why couldn't they make sure the scriptures were written in their lifetimes?) work for nontheistic religions. But it does seem to work for all theistic religions, at least in this sense, it is better than the problem of evil, which only explains the nonexistence of the Abrahamic god, but can't explain the nonexistence of the other theistic gods.

See [this post](https://ksr.onl/blog/2021/12/the-unimpressiveness-of-the-religious-miracles.html){:target="_blank"} which works for even these religions.

**Note**: The crux of this argument was made by me on [11th July 2021](http://www.wall.org/~aron/blog/comparing-religions-v-historical-accounts/#comment-2650665){:target="_blank"} as a comment on a post by Aron Wall. But this post is written in 2024.
